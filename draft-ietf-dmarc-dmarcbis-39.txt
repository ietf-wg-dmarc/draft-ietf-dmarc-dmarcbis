Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
                      draft-ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis-39

Abstract

   This document describes the Domain-based Message Authentication,
   Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) protocol.

   DMARC permits the owner of an email's Author Domain (#author-domain)
   to enable validation of the domain's use, to indicate the Domain
   Owner's (#domain-owner) or Public Suffix Operator's (#public-suffix-
   operator) message handling preference regarding failed validation,
   and to request reports about the use of the domain name.  Mail
   receiving organizations can use this information when evaluating
   handling choices for incoming mail.

   This document obsoletes RFCs 7489 and 9091.

1.  Introduction

   RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH BEFORE PUBLISHING:
   The source for this draft is maintained on GitHub at:

   Abusive email often includes unauthorized and deceptive use of a
   domain name in the "From" header field defined in section 3.6.2 of
   [RFC5322] and referred to as RFC5322.From.  The domain typically
   belongs to an organization expected to be known to - and presumably
   trusted by - the recipient.  The Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
   [RFC7208] and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) [RFC6376] protocols

   provide domain-level authentication but are not directly associated
   with the RFC5322.From domain, also known as the Author Domain
   (#author-domain).  DMARC leverages these two protocols, providing a
   method for Domain Owners to publish a DNS TXT record describing the
   email authentication policies for the Author Domain and to request
   specific handling for messages using that domain that fail validation
   checks.  These DNS records are called DMARC Policy Records (#dmarc-
   policy-record).

   As with SPF and DKIM, DMARC validation results in a verdict of either
   "pass" or "fail".  A DMARC result of "pass" requires not only an SPF
   or DKIM pass verdict for the email message, but also and more
   importantly that the domain associated with the SPF or DKIM pass be
   "aligned" with the Author Domain in one of two modes - "relaxed" or
   "strict".  Domains are said to be in "relaxed alignment" if they have
   the same Organizational Domain (#organizational-domain); a domain's
   Organizational Domain is the domain at the top of the namespace
   hierarchy for that domain while having the same administrative
   authority as that domain.  On the other hand, domains are in "strict
   alignment" if and only if they are identical.  The choice of required
   alignment mode is left to the Domain Owner (#domain-owner) that
   publishes a DMARC Policy Record.

   A DMARC pass for a message indicates only that the use of the Author
   Domain has been validated for that message as authorized by the
   Domain Owner.  Such authorization does not carry an explicit or
   implicit value assertion about that message or about the Domain
   Owner, and so a DMARC pass by itself does not guarantee that delivery
   to the recipient's Inbox would be safe or desirable.  For a mail-
   receiving organization participating in DMARC, a message that passes
   DMARC validation is part of a message stream reliably associated with
   the Author Domain.  Therefore, reputation assessment of that stream
   by the mail-receiving organization can assume the use of that Author
   Domain is authorized by the Domain Owner.

   On the other hand, a message that fails this validation is not
   necessarily associated with the Author Domain and so should not
   affect the Author Domain's reputation.  The phrase "not necessarily
   associated" was purposely chosen here, as it is importatnt to
   understand that some messages making authorized use of the Author
   Domain can still fail DMARC validation checks.  [RFC7960] and
   Section 7 of this document both discuss reasons why such failures may
   happen.  Because of this, a mail-receiving organization that performs
   DMARC validation can choose to honor the Domain Owner's requested
   message handling for validation failures, but it is not required to
   do so.  DMARC is commonly used as one input to more complex filtering
   decisions, and so the mail-receiving organization might choose
   different actions entirely.

   DMARC, in the associated [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] and
   [I-D.ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting] documents, also specifies a
   reporting framework.  Using it, a mail-receiving organization can
   generate regular reports about messages that use Author Domains for
   which a DMARC Policy Record exists; those reports are sent to the
   address(es) specified by the Domain Owner in the DMARC Policy Record.
   Domain Owners can use these reports, especially the aggregate
   reports, not only to identify sources of mail attempting to
   fraudulently use their domain, but also (and perhaps more
   importantly) to flag and fix gaps in their own authentication
   practices.  However, as with honoring the Domain Owner's stated mail
   handling preference, a mail-receiving organization supporting DMARC
   is under no obligation to send requested reports, although it is
   recommended that they do send aggregate reports.

   The use of DMARC creates some interoperability challenges that
   require due consideration before deployment, particularly with
   configurations that can cause mail to be rejected.  These are
   discussed in Section 7.

2.  Requirements

   The following sections describe topics that guide the specification
   of DMARC.

2.1.  High-Level Goals

   DMARC has the following high-level goals:

   *  Allow Domain Owners (#domain-owner) and Public Suffix Operators
      (PSOs) (#public-suffix-operator) to validate their email
      authentication deployments.

   *  Allow Domain Owners and PSOs to assert their desired message
      handling for validation failures on messages purporting to have
      authorship within the domain.

   *  Minimize implementation complexity for both senders and receivers.

   *  Reduce the amount of successfully delivered spoofed emails.

   *  Work at Internet scale.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


2.2.  Anti-Phishing

   DMARC is designed to prevent the unauthorized use of the Author
   Domain (#author-domain) of an email message, a technique known as
   "spoofing".  Such unauthorized usage can frequently be found in
   messages impersonating a domain belonging to a business entity,
   messages that are meant to entice the recipient to provide sensitive
   information, such as usernames, passwords, and financial account
   information.  These spoofed messages are commonly referred to as
   "phishing".

   DMARC can only be used to combat specific forms of exact-domain
   spoofing directly.  DMARC does not attempt to solve all problems with
   spoofed or otherwise fraudulent emails.  In particular, it does not
   address the use of visually similar domain names or abuse of the
   RFC5322.From human-readable display-name, as defined in Section 3.4
   of [RFC5322].

2.3.  Scalability

   Scalability is a significant issue for systems that need to operate
   in an environment as widely deployed as current SMTP email.  For this
   reason, DMARC seeks to avoid the need for third parties or pre-
   sending agreements between senders and receivers.  This preserves the
   positive aspects of the current email infrastructure.

   Although DMARC does not introduce third-party senders (namely
   external agents authorized to send on behalf of an operator) to the
   email-handling flow, it also does not preclude them.  Such third
   parties are free to provide services in conjunction with DMARC.

2.4.  Out of Scope

   Several topics and issues are specifically out of scope of this work.
   These include the following:

   *  Different treatment of messages that are not authenticated (e.g.,
      those that have no DKIM signature or those sent using an Author
      Domain (#author-domain) for which no DMARC Policy Record (#dmarc-
      policy-record) exists) versus those that fail validation;

   *  Evaluation of anything other than RFC5322.From header field;

   *  Multiple reporting formats;

   *  Publishing policy other than via the DNS;

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   *  Reporting or otherwise evaluating other than the last-hop IP
      address;

   *  Attacks in the display-name portions of the RFC5322.From header
      field, also known as "display name" attacks;

   *  Authentication of entities other than domains, since DMARC is
      built upon SPF and DKIM, which authenticate domains; and

   *  Content analysis.

3.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

3.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are encouraged to be familiar with the contents of [RFC5598].
   In particular, that document defines various roles in the messaging
   infrastructure that can appear the same or separate in various
   contexts.  For example, a Domain Owner (#domain-owner) could, via the
   messaging security mechanisms on which DMARC is based, delegate the
   ability to send mail as the Domain Owner to a third party with
   another role.  This document does not address the distinctions among
   such roles; the reader is encouraged to become familiar with that
   material before continuing.

3.2.  Definitions

   The following sections define the terms used in this document.

3.2.1.  Authenticated Identifiers

   Authenticated Identifiers are those domain-level identifiers for
   which authorized use is validated using a supported authentication
   mechanism (#authentication-mechanisms).

3.2.2.  Author Domain

   The domain name of the apparent author as extracted from the
   RFC5322.From header field.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


3.2.3.  DKIM Signing Domain

   The domain name that is the value of the "d" tag in a validated DKIM-
   Signature header field in an email message.

3.2.4.  SPF Domain

   SPF, [RFC7208], can validate the uses of both the domain found in an
   SMTP [RFC5321] HELO/EHLO command (the HELO identity) and the domain
   found in an SMTP MAIL command (the MAIL FROM identity).  DMARC relies
   solely on SPF validation of the MAIL FROM identity.  Section 2.4 of
   [RFC7208] describes the determination of the MAIL FROM identity for
   cases in which the SMTP MAIL command has a null path, i.e., the
   mailbox composed of the local-part "postmaster" and the HELO
   identity.

   The term "SPF Domain" when used in this document refers to an SPF
   validated MAIL FROM identity.

3.2.5.  DMARC Policy Domain

   The domain name at which an applicable DMARC Policy Record (#dmarc-
   policy-record) is discovered for the Author Domain (#author-domain)
   of an email message.

3.2.6.  DMARC Policy Record

   A DNS TXT record published by a Domain Owner (#domain-owner) or
   Public Suffix Operator (PSO) (#public-suffix-operator) to enable
   validation of an Author Domain's (#author-domain) use, to indicate
   the Domain Owner's or PSO's message handling preference regarding
   failed validation, and optionally to request reports about the use of
   the Author Domain.

3.2.7.  Domain Owner

   An entity or organization that has control of a given DNS domain,
   usually by holding its registration.  Domain Owners range from
   complex, globally distributed organizations to service providers
   working on behalf of non-technical clients to individuals responsible
   for maintaining personal domains.  This specification uses this term
   as analogous to an Administrative Management Domain as defined in
   [RFC5598].  It can also refer to delegates, such as Report Consumers
   when those are outside of their immediate management domain.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


3.2.8.  Domain Owner Assessment Policy

   The message handling preference expressed in a DMARC Policy Record
   (#dmarc-policy-record) by the Domain Owner (#domain-owner) regarding
   failed validation of the Author Domain (#author-domain) is called the
   "Domain Owner Assessment Policy".  Possible values are described in
   Section 4.7.

3.2.9.  Enforcement

   Enforcement describes a state where the existing Domain Owner
   Assessment Policy (#domain-owner-policy) for an Organizational Domain
   (#organizational-domain) and all subdomains below it is not "p=none".
   This state means that the Organizational Domain and its subdomains
   can only be used as Author Domains (#author-domain) if they are
   properly validated using the DMARC mechanism.

   Historically, Domain Owner Assessment Policies of "p=quarantine" or
   "p=reject" have been higher value signals to Mail Receivers (#mail-
   receiver).  Messages with Author Domains for which such policies
   exist that are not validated using the DMARC mechanism will not reach
   the inbox at Mail Receivers that participate in DMARC and honor the
   Domain Owner's expressed handling preference.

3.2.10.  Identifier Alignment

   DMARC describes the concept of alignment between the Author Domain
   (#author-domain) and an Authenticated Identifier (#authenticated-
   identifiers), and requires such Identifier Alignment between the two
   for a message to achieve a DMARC pass.  DMARC defines two states for
   alignment.

3.2.10.1.  Relaxed Alignment

   When the Author Domain (#author-domain) has the same Organizational
   Domain (#organizational-domain) as an Authenticated Identifier
   (#authenticated-identifier), the two are said to be in relaxed
   alignment.

3.2.10.2.  Strict Alignment

   When the Author Domain (#author-domain) is identical to an
   Authenticated Identifier (#authenticated-identifier), the two are
   said to be in strict alignment.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


3.2.11.  Mail Receiver

   The entity or organization that receives and processes email.  Mail
   Receivers operate one or more Internet-facing Message Transfer Agents
   (MTAs).

3.2.12.  Monitoring Mode

   Monitoring Mode describes a state where the existing Domain Owner
   Assessment Policy (#domain-owner-policy) for an Organizational Domain
   (#organizational-domain) and all subdomains below it is "p=none", and
   the Domain Owner (#domain-owner) is receiving aggregate reports for
   the Organizational Domain.  While the use of the Organizational
   Domain and all its subdomains as Author Domains (#author-domain) can
   still be validated by a Mail Receiver (#mail-receiver) deploying the
   DMARC mechanism, the Domain Owner expresses no handling preference
   for messages that fail DMARC validation.  The Domain Owner is,
   however, using the content of the DMARC aggregate reports to make any
   needed adjustments to the authentication practices for its mail
   streams.

3.2.13.  Non-existent Domains

   For DMARC purposes, a non-existent domain is consistent with the
   term's meaning as described in [RFC8020].  That is, if the response
   code received for a query for a domain name is NXDOMAIN, then the
   domain name and any possible subdomains do not exist.

3.2.14.  Organizational Domain

   The Organizational Domain for any domain is akin to the ADMD
   described in [RFC5598].  A domain's Organizational Domain is the
   domain at the top of the namespace hierarchy for that domain while
   having the same administrative authority as the domain.  An
   Organizational Domain is determined by applying the algorithm found
   in Section 4.10.

3.2.15.  Public Suffix Domain (PSD)

   Some domains allow the registration of subdomains that are "owned" by
   independent organizations.  Real-world examples of these domains are
   ".com", ".org", ".us", and ".co.uk", to name just a few.  These
   domains are called "Public Suffix Domains" (PSDs).  For example,
   "ietf.org" is a registered domain name, and ".org" is its PSD.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


3.2.16.  Public Suffix Operator (PSO)

   A Public Suffix Operator is an organization that manages operations
   within a PSD, particularly the DNS records published for names at and
   under that domain name.

3.2.17.  PSO Controlled Domain Names

   PSO-Controlled Domain Names are names in the DNS that are managed by
   a PSO.  PSO-controlled Domain Names may have one label (e.g., ".com")
   or more (e.g., ".co.uk"), depending on the PSD's policy.

3.2.18.  Report Consumer

   A Report Consumer is an operator that receives reports from another
   operator implementing the reporting mechanisms described in the
   documents [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] and
   [I-D.ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting].  This term applies collectively
   to the system components that receive and process these reports and
   the organizations that operate those components.

   Report Consumers can receive reports concerning domains for which the
   Report Consumer is also the Domain Owner (#domain-owner) or PSO
   (#public-suffix-operator), or concerning domains that belong to
   another operator entirely.  The DMARC mechanism permits a Domain
   Owner to act as a Report Consumer for its domain(s) and/or to
   designate third parties to so act.  See Section 11.6 for further
   discussion of such designation.

4.  Overview and Key Concepts

   This section provides a general overview of the design and operation
   of the DMARC environment.

4.1.  DMARC Basics

   DMARC permits a Domain Owner (#domain-owner) or PSO (#public-suffix-
   operator) to enable validation of an Author Domain's (#author-domain)
   use in an email message, to indicate the Domain Owner's or PSO's
   message handling preference regarding failed validation, and to
   request reports about use of the Author Domain.  A domain's DMARC
   Policy Record (#dmarc-policy-record) is published in the DNS as a TXT
   record at the name created by prepending the label "_dmarc" to the
   domain name and is retrieved through normal DNS queries.

   DMARC's validation mechanism produces a "pass" result if a DMARC
   Policy Record exists for the Author Domain of an email message and
   the Author Domain is aligned (#identifier-alignment) with an



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   Authenticated Identifier (#authenticated-identifiers) from that
   message.  When a DMARC Policy Record exists for the Author Domain and
   the DMARC mechanism does not produce a "pass" result, the Mail
   Receiver's (#mail-receiver) handling of that message can be
   influenced by the Domain Owner Assessment Policy (#domain-owner-
   policy) expressed in the DMARC Policy Record.

   It is important to note that the authentication mechanisms employed
   by DMARC only validate the usage of a DNS domain in an email message.
   They do not validate the local-part of any email address identifier
   found in that message, nor do such validations carry an explicit or
   implicit value assertion about that message or about the Domain
   Owner.

   DMARC's reporting component involves the collection of information
   about received messages using the Author Domain for periodic
   aggregate reports to the Domain Owner or PSO.  The parameters and
   format for such reports are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

   A Mail Receiver participating in DMARC might also generate per-
   message failure reports that contain information related to
   individual messages that fail DMARC validation checks.  Per-message
   failure reports are a useful source of information when debugging
   deployments (if messages can be determined to be legitimate even
   though failing validation) or in analyzing attacks.  The capability
   for such services is enabled by DMARC but defined in other referenced
   material such as [RFC6591] and [I-D.ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting]

4.2.  Use of RFC5322.From

   One of the most obvious points of security scrutiny for DMARC is the
   choice to focus on an identifier, namely the RFC5322.From address,
   which is part of a body of data that has been trivially forged
   throughout the history of email.  This field is the one used by end
   users to identify the source of the message, and so it has always
   been a prime target for abuse through such forgery and other means.
   That said, of all the identifiers that are part of the message
   itself, this is the only one required to be present.  A message
   without a single, properly formed RFC5322.From header field does not
   comply with [RFC5322], and handling such a message is outside of the
   scope of this specification.

4.3.  Authentication Mechanisms

   The following mechanisms for determining Authenticated Identifiers
   (#authenticated-identifiers) are supported in this version of DMARC:




Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   *  DKIM, [RFC6376].  The DKIM Signing Domain (#dkim-signing-domain)
      from a validated DKIM-Signature header field is an Authenticated
      Identifier.

   *  SPF, [RFC7208].  The validated SPF Domain (#spf-domain) from the
      email message is the Authenticated Identifier.

4.4.  Identifier Alignment Explained

   DMARC validates the authorized use of the Author Domain (#author-
   domain) by requiring either that it have the same Organizational
   Domain (#organizational-domain) as an Authenticated Identifier
   (#authenticated-identifier) (a condition known as "Relaxed Alignment
   (#relaxed-alignment)") or that it be identical to the Authenticated
   Identifier (a condition known as "Strict Alignment (#strict-
   alignment)").  The choice of relaxed or strict alignment is left to
   the Domain Owner (#domain-owner) and is expressed in the domain's
   DMARC Policy Record (#dmarc-policy-record).  In practice, nearly all
   Domain Owners have found relaxed alignment sufficient to meet their
   needs.  Domain name comparisons in this context are case-insensitive,
   per [RFC4343].

   The following table is meant to illustrate possible alignment
   conditions.

   +==================+==================+=========================+
   | Authenticated    | Author Domain    | Identifier Alignment    |
   | Identifier       |                  |                         |
   +==================+==================+=========================+
   | foo.example.com  | news.example.com | relaxed; the two have   |
   |                  |                  | the same Organizational |
   |                  |                  | Domain, example.com     |
   +------------------+------------------+-------------------------+
   | news.example.com | news.example.com | strict; the two are     |
   |                  |                  | identical               |
   +------------------+------------------+-------------------------+
   | foo.example.net  | news.example.com | none; the two do not    |
   |                  |                  | share a common          |
   |                  |                  | Organizational Domain   |
   +------------------+------------------+-------------------------+

                     Table 1: "Alignment Examples"

   It is important to note that Identifier Alignment cannot occur with a
   message that is not valid per [RFC5322], particularly one with a
   malformed, absent, or repeated RFC5322.From header field, since in
   that case there is no reliable way to determine a DMARC Policy Record
   (#dmarc-policy-record) that applies to the message.  Accordingly,



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   DMARC operation is predicated on the input being a valid RFC5322
   message object.  For non-compliant cases, handling is outside of the
   scope of this specification.  Further discussion of this can be found
   in Section 11.5.

4.4.1.  DKIM-Authenticated Identifiers

   DKIM permits a Domain Owner to claim some responsibility for a
   message by associating the domain to the message.  This association
   is done by inserting the domain as the value of the "d" tag in a
   DKIM-Signature header field, and the assertion of responsibility is
   validated through a cryptographic signature in the header field.  If
   the cryptographic signature validates, then the DKIM Signing Domain
   is the DKIM-Authenticated Identifier.

   There is currently no generally accepted mechanism by which a Domain
   Owner may assert a list of third-party DKIM Signing Domains that are
   authorized to sign on behalf of a given Author Domain.  Therefore,
   DMARC requires that Identifier Alignment is applied to the DKIM-
   Authenticated Identifier because a message can bear a valid signature
   from any domain, even one used by a bad actor.  A DKIM-Authenticated
   Identifier that does not have Identifier Alignment with the Author
   Domain is not enough to validate whether the use of the Author Domain
   has been authorized by its Domain Owner.

   A single email can contain multiple DKIM signatures, and it is
   considered to produce a DMARC "pass" result if any DKIM-Authenticated
   Identifier aligns with the Author Domain.

4.4.2.  SPF-Authenticated Identifiers

   SPF can validate the uses of both the domain found in an SMTP HELO/
   EHLO command (the HELO identity) and the domain found in an SMTP MAIL
   command (the MAIL FROM identity).  DMARC relies solely on SPF
   validation of the MAIL FROM identity.  If the use of the domain in
   the MAIL FROM identity is validated by SPF, then that domain is the
   SPF-Authenticated Identifier.

   There is currently no generally accepted mechanism by which a Domain
   Owner may assert a list of third-party domains that are authorized
   for use as the MAIL FROM identity for mail using a given Author
   Domain.  Therefore, DMARC requires that Identifier Alignment is
   applied to the SPF-Authenticated Identifier because any Domain Owner,
   even a bad actor, can publish an SPF record for its domain and send
   email that will obtain an SPF pass result.  An SPF-Authenticated
   Identifier that does not have Identifier Alignment with the Author
   Domain is not enough to validate whether the use of the Author Domain
   has been authorized by its Domain Owner.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


4.4.3.  Alignment and Extension Technologies

   If in the future DMARC is extended to include the use of other
   authentication mechanisms, the extensions MUST allow for the
   assignment of a domain as an Authenticated Identifier so that
   alignment with the Author Domain can be validated.

4.5.  DMARC Policy Record Explained

   A Domain Owner (#domain-owner) or PSO (#public-suffix-operator)
   advertises DMARC participation of one or more of its domains by
   publishing DMARC Policy Records (#dmarc-policy-record) that will
   apply to those domains.  In doing so, Domain Owners and PSOs indicate
   their handling preference regarding failed validation for email
   messages using their domain in the RFC5322.From header field as well
   as their desire (if any) to receive feedback about such messages in
   the form of aggregate and/or failure reports.

   DMARC Policy Records are stored as DNS TXT records with names
   starting with the label "_dmarc".  For example, the Domain Owner of
   "example.com" would publish a DMARC Policy Record at the name
   "_dmarc.example.com", and a Mail Receiver (#mail-receiver) wishing to
   find the DMARC Policy Record for mail with an Author Domain (#author-
   domain) of "example.com" would issue a TXT query to the DNS for the
   name "_dmarc.example.com".  A Domain Owner or PSO may choose not to
   participate in DMARC validation by Mail Receivers simply by not
   publishing a DMARC Policy Record for its Author Domain(s).

   DMARC Policy Records can also apply to subdomains of the name at
   which they are published in the DNS, if the record is published at an
   Organizational Domain (#organizational-domain) for the subdomains.
   The Domain Owner Assessment Policy (#domain-owner-policy) that
   applies to the subdomains can be identical to the Domain Owner
   Assessment Policy that applies to the Organizational Domain or
   different, depending on the presence or absence of certain values in
   the DMARC Policy Record.  See Section 4.7 for more details.

   DMARC's use of the Domain Name Service is driven by DMARC's use of
   domain names and the nature of the query it performs.  The query
   requirement matches with the DNS for obtaining simple parametric
   information.  It uses an established method of storing the
   information associated with the domain name targeted by a DNS query,
   specifically an isolated TXT record that is restricted to the DMARC
   context.  Using the DNS as the query service has the benefit of
   reusing an extremely well-established operations, administration, and
   management infrastructure, rather than creating a new one.

   Per [RFC1035], a TXT record can comprise multiple "character-string"
   objects.  Where this is the case, the module performing DMARC
   evaluation MUST concatenate these strings by joining together the
   objects in order and parsing the result as a single string.

   A Domain Owner can choose not to have some underlying authentication
   mechanisms apply to DMARC evaluation of its Author Domain(s).  For
   example, if a Domain Owner only wants to use DKIM as the underlying
   authentication mechanism, then the Domain Owner does not publish an
   SPF record that can produce Identifier Alignment between an SPF-
   Authenticated Identifier and the Author Domain.  Alternatively, if
   the Domain Owner wishes to rely solely on SPF, then it can send email
   messages that have no DKIM-Signature header field that would produce
   Identifier Alignment between a DKIM-Authenticated Identifier and the
   Author Domain.  Neither approach is recommended, however.

   A Mail Receiver implementing the DMARC mechanism gets the Domain
   Owner's or PSO's published Domain Owner Assessment Policy and can use
   it to inform its handling decisions for messages that undergo DMARC
   validation checks and do not produce a result of pass.  Mail handling
   considerations based on Domain Owner Assessment Policy enforcement
   are discussed below in Section 5.4.

4.6.  DMARC Reporting URIs

   [RFC3986] defines a syntax for identifying a resource.  The DMARC
   mechanism uses this as the format by which a Domain Owner (#domain-
   owner) or PSO (#public-suffix-organization) specifies the
   destination(s) for the two report types that are supported.  The
   DMARC Policy Record format (#policy-record-format) allows for a list
   of these URIs to be provided, with each URI separated by commas
   (ASCII 0x2c).

   A formal definition is provided in Section 4.8.

4.7.  DMARC Policy Record Format

   DMARC Policy Records follow the extensible "tag-value" syntax for
   DNS-based key records defined in DKIM [RFC6376].

   Section 9 creates a registry for known DMARC tags and registers the
   initial set defined in this document.  Only tags defined in that
   registry are to be processed; unknown tags MUST be ignored.

   The following tags are valid DMARC tags:

   adkim:  (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "r".)  Indicates whether

      the Domain Owner (#domain-owner) or PSO (#public-suffix-
      organization) requires strict or relaxed DKIM Identifier Alignment
      mode.  See Section 4.4.1 for details.  Valid values are as
      follows:

      r:  relaxed mode
      s:  strict mode

   aspf:  (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "r".)  Indicates whether the
      Domain Owner or PSO requires strict or relaxed SPF Identifier
      Alignment mode.  See Section 4.4.2 for details.  Valid values are
      as follows:

      r:  relaxed mode
      s:  strict mode

   fo:  Failure reporting options (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "0")
      Provides requested options for the generation of failure reports.
      Report generators may choose to adhere to the requested options.
      This tag's content MUST be ignored if a "ruf" tag (below) is not
      also specified.  This tag can include one or more of the values
      shown here, with the exception that "0" and "1" are mutually
      exclusive.  If more than one value is assigned to the tag, the
      list of values should be separated by colons (e.g., fo=0:d), and
      the values may appear in the list in any order.  Valid values and
      their meanings are:

      0:  Generate a DMARC failure report if all underlying
         authentication mechanisms fail to produce an aligned "pass"
         result.
      1:  Generate a DMARC failure report if any underlying
         authentication mechanism fails to produce an aligned "pass"
         result.
      d:  Generate a DKIM failure report if the message had a signature
         that failed evaluation, regardless of its alignment.  DKIM-
         specific reporting is described in [RFC6651].
      s:  Generate an SPF failure report if the message failed SPF
         evaluation, regardless of its alignment.  SPF-specific
         reporting is described in [RFC6652].

   np:  Domain Owner Assessment Policy (#domain-owner-policy) for non-
      existent subdomains of the given Organizational Domain (plain-
      text; OPTIONAL).  For this tag, the definition of "non-existent
      subdomain" is the same as that used for "Non-existent Domains" in
      Section 3.2.13.  The policy expressed by this tag indicates the
      message handling preference of the Domain Owner or PSO for mail
      using non-existent subdomains of the prevailing Organizational
      Domain and not passing DMARC validation.  It applies only to non-

      existent subdomains of the Organizational Domain queried and not
      to either existing subdomains or the domain itself.  Its syntax is
      identical to that of the "p" tag defined below.  If the "np" tag
      is absent, the policy specified by the "sp" tag (if the "sp" tag
      is present) or the policy specified by the "p" tag, if the "sp"
      tag is not present, MUST be applied for non-existent subdomains.

   p:  Domain Owner Assessment Policy (#domain-owner-policy) (plain-
      text; RECOMMENDED for DMARC Policy Records).  Indicates the
      message handling preference of the Domain Owner or PSO for mail
      using its domain but not passing DMARC validation.  The policy
      applies to the domain queried and to subdomains, unless the
      subdomain policy is explicitly described using the "sp" or "np"
      tags.  If this tag is not present in an otherwise syntactically
      valid DMARC Policy Record, then the record is treated as if it
      included "p=none" (see Section 4.10.1).  This tag is not
      applicable for third-party reporting records (see
      [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] and
      [I-D.ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting]).  Possible values are as
      follows:

      none:  The Domain Owner offers no expression of preference.
      quarantine:  The Domain Owner considers such mail to be
         suspicious.  It is possible the mail is valid, although the
         failure creates a significant concern.
      reject:  The Domain Owner considers all such failures to be a
         clear indication that the use of the domain name is not valid.
         See Section 7.2 for some discussion of SMTP rejection methods
         and their implications.

   psd:  A flag indicating whether the domain is a PSD. (plain-text;
      OPTIONAL; default is "u").  Possible values are:

      y:  PSOs include this tag with a value of "y" to indicate that the
         domain is a PSD.  If a record containing this tag with a value
         of "y" is found during policy discovery, this information will
         be used to determine the Organizational Domain and DMARC Policy
         Domain applicable to the message in question.
      n:  The DMARC Policy Record is published for a domain that is not
         a PSD, but it is the Organizational Domain for itself and its
         subdomains.
      u:  The default indicates that the DMARC Policy Record is
         published for a domain that is not a PSD, and may or may not be
         an Organizational Domain for itself and its subdomains.  Use
         the mechanism described in Section 4.10 for determining the
         Organizational Domain for this domain.

   rua:  Addresses to which aggregate feedback reports are to be sent

      (comma-separated plain-text list of DMARC Reporting URIs;
      OPTIONAL).  If present, the Domain Owner is requesting Mail
      Receivers to send aggregate feedback reports as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] to the URIs listed.  Any
      valid URI can be specified.  A Mail Receiver that sends aggregate
      feedback reports MUST implement support for a "mailto:" URI, i.e.,
      the ability to send a DMARC report via electronic mail.  If the
      tag is not provided, Mail Receivers MUST NOT generate aggregate
      feedback reports for the domain.  URIs involving schemes not
      supported by Mail Receivers MUST be ignored.
      [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] also discusses considerations
      that apply when the domain name of a URI differs from the domain
      publishing the DMARC Policy Record.  See Section 11.6 for
      additional considerations.

   ruf:  Addresses to which message-specific failure information is to
      be reported (comma-separated plain-text list of DMARC URIs;
      OPTIONAL).  If present, the Domain Owner is requesting Mail
      Receivers to send detailed failure reports about messages that
      fail the DMARC evaluation in specific ways (see the "fo" tag
      above) to the URIs listed.  Depending on the value of the "fo"
      tag, the format for such reports is described in
      [I-D.ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting], [RFC6651], or [RFC6652].  Any
      valid URI can be specified.  A Mail Receiver sending failure
      reports MUST implement support for a "mailto:" URI, i.e., the
      ability to send message-specific failure information via
      electronic mail.  If the tag is not provided, Mail Receivers MUST
      NOT generate failure reports for the domain.  URIs involving
      schemes not supported by Mail Receivers MUST be ignored.
      [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] discusses considerations that
      apply when the domain name of a URI differs from that of the
      domain advertising the policy.  See Section 11.6 for additional
      considerations.

   sp:  Domain Owner Assessment Policy for all subdomains of the given
      Organizational Domain (plain-text; OPTIONAL).  Indicates the
      message handling preference of the Domain Owner or PSO for mail
      using an existing subdomain of the prevailing Organizational
      Domain for and not passing DMARC validation.  It applies only to
      existing subdomains of the message's Organizational Domain in the
      DNS hierarchy and not to the Organizational Domain itself.  Its
      syntax is identical to that of the "p" tag defined above.  If both
      the "sp" tag is absent, and the "np" tag is either absent or not
      applicable, the policy specified by the "p" tag MUST be applied
      for subdomains.  Note that "sp" will be ignored for DMARC Policy
      Records published on subdomains of Organizational Domains and PSDs
      due to the effect of the DMARC Policy Discovery (#dmarc-policy-
      discovery).

   t:  DMARC policy test mode (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "n").
      For the Author Domain to which the DMARC Policy Record applies,
      the "t" tag serves as a signal to the actor performing DMARC
      validation checks as to whether or not the Domain Owner wishes the
      Domain Owner Assessment Policy declared in the "p", "sp", and/or
      "np" tags to actually be applied.  This tag does not affect the
      generation of DMARC reports, and it has no effect on any policy
      ("p", "sp", or "np") that is "none".  See Appendix A.6 for further
      discussion of the use of this tag.  Possible values are as
      follows:

      y:  A request that the actor performing the DMARC validation check
         not apply the policy, but instead apply any special handling
         rules it might have in place, such as rewriting the
         RFC5322.From header field (see Appendix A.6).  The Domain Owner
         is currently testing its specified DMARC assessment policy, and
         has an expectation that the policy applied to any failing
         messages will be one level below the specified policy.  That
         is, if the policy is "quarantine" and the value of the "t" tag
         is "y", a policy of "none" will be applied to failing messages;
         if the policy is "reject" and the value of the "t" tag is "y",
         a policy of "quarantine" will be applied to failing messages,
         irrespective of any other special handling rules that might be
         triggered by the "t" tag having a value of "y".
      n:  The default is a request to apply the Domain Owner Assessment
         Policy as specified to any message that produces a DMARC "fail"
         result.

   v:  Version (plain-text; REQUIRED).  Identifies the record retrieved
      as a DMARC Policy Record.  It MUST have the value of "DMARC1".
      The value of this tag MUST match precisely; if it does not or it
      is absent, the entire record MUST be ignored.  It MUST be the
      first tag in the list.

   A DMARC Policy Record MUST comply with the formal specification found
   in Section 4.8 in that the "v" tag MUST be present and MUST appear
   first.  Unknown tags MUST be ignored.  Syntax errors in the remainder
   of the record MUST be discarded in favor of default values (if any)
   or ignored outright.

   Note that given the rules of the previous paragraph, the addition of
   a new tag into the registered list of tags does not itself require a
   new version of DMARC to be generated (with a corresponding change to
   the "v" tag's value), but a change to any existing tags does require
   a new version of DMARC.

4.8.  Formal Definition

   The formal definition of the DMARC Policy Record format, using
   [RFC5234] and [RFC7405], is as follows:

  dmarc-uri     = URI
                ; "URI" is imported from [RFC3986];
                ; commas (ASCII 0x2C) and exclamation
                ; points (ASCII 0x21) MUST be
                ; encoded

  obs-dmarc-uri = dmarc-uri "!" 1*DIGIT [ "k" / "m" / "g" / "t" ]
                ; Obsolete syntax, reporters should ignore the
                ; size if it is found in a DMARC Policy Record.

  dmarc-sep     = *WSP ";" *WSP

  equals        = *WSP "=" *WSP

  dmarc-record  = dmarc-version *(dmarc-sep dmarc-tag) [dmarc-sep]

  dmarc-tag     = 1*ALPHA equals 1*dmarc-value

  ; any printing characters but semicolon
  dmarc-value   = %x20-3A / %x3C-7E

  dmarc-version = "v" equals %s"DMARC1" ; case sensitive

  ; specialized syntax of DMARC values
  dmarc-request = "none" / "quarantine" / "reject"

  dmarc-yorn    = "y" / "n"

  dmarc-psd     = "y" / "n" / "u"

  dmarc-rors    = "r" / "s"

  dmarc-urilist = (dmarc-uri / obs-dmarc-uri) *(*WSP "," *WSP (dmarc-uri / obs-dmarc-uri))

  dmarc-fo      = ("0" / "1") *(":" dmarc-afrf)
                / dmarc-afrf [":" ("0" / "1")] [":" dmarc-afrf]
                / *(dmarc-afrf ":") ("0" / "1")

  dmarc-afrf    = "d" / "s"
                ; each may appear at most once in dmarc-fo

   In each dmarc-tag, the dmarc-value has a syntax that depends on the
   tag name.  The ABNF rule for each dmarc-value is specified in the
   following table:

   The above diagram shows a typical flow of messages through a DMARC-
   aware system.  Dashed lines (e.g., -->) denote the actual message
   flow, dotted lines (e.g., < . . >) represent DNS queries used to
   retrieve message policy related to the supported message
   authentication schemes, and starred lines (e.g., <**>) indicate data
   exchange between message-handling modules and message authentication
   modules. "sMTA" is the sending MTA, and "rMTA" is the receiving MTA.

   Put simply, when a message reaches a DMARC-aware rMTA, a DNS query
   will be initiated to determine if a DMARC Policy Record exists that
   applies to the Author Domain.  If a DMARC Policy Record is found, the
   rMTA will use the results of SPF and DKIM validation checks to
   determine DMARC validation status.  The DMARC validation status can
   then factor into the message handling decision made by the
   recipient's mail system.

   More details on specific actions for the parties involved can be
   found in Section 5.1 and Section 5.3.

4.10.  DNS Tree Walk

   An Organizational Domain (#organizational-domain) serves two
   different purposes, depending on the context:

   *  The Organizational Domain of the Author Domain (#author-domain)
      establishes the DMARC Policy Record (#dmarc-policy-record) for
      that domain when no DMARC Policy Record is published specifically
      for the Author Domain. (see Section 4.10.1)

   *  The Organizational Domains of an Authenticated Identifier
      (#authenticated-identifiers) and the Author Domain are used in
      determining Identifier Alignment between the two. (see
      Section 4.10.2).

   [RFC7489] defined an Organizational Domain as "The domain that was
   registered with a domain name registrar."  RFC 7489 discussed using a
   "public suffix" list (PSL) as the authoritative list of the parent
   domains for Organizational Domains, and further described a method
   for determining the Organizational Domain of an Author Domain or an
   Authenticated Identifier.  However, RFC 7489 mandated no requirement
   for a specific PSL for Mail Receivers to use (though it did suggest
   the one found at https://publicsuffix.org/
   (https://publicsuffix.org/)) nor did it provide any guidance for the
   frequency of regular retrieval of the PSL by Mail Receivers
   participating in DMARC.  RFC 7489 acknowledged the possibility of
   interoperability issues caused by Mail Receivers choosing different
   PSLs, and even suggested that if a more reliable and secure method
   for determining the Organizational Domain could be created, that
   method should replace reliance on a public suffix list.

   This update to DMARC offers more flexibility to Domain Owners,
   especially those with large, complex organizations that might want to
   apply decentralized management to their DNS and their DMARC Policy
   Records.  Rather than just using a public suffix list to help
   identify an Organizational Domain, this update defines a discovery
   technique known colloquially as the "DNS Tree Walk".  The target of
   any DNS Tree Walk is discovery of a valid DMARC Policy Record, and
   its use in determining an Organizational Domain allows for publishing
   DMARC Policy Records at multiple points in the namespace.

   This flexibility comes at a possible cost, however.  Since the DNS
   Tree Walk relies on the Mail Receiver making a series of DNS queries,
   the potential exists for an ill-intentioned Domain Owner to send mail
   with Author Domains with tens or even hundreds of labels for the
   purpose of executing a Denial of Service Attack on the Mail Receiver.
   To guard against such abuse of the DNS, a shortcut is built into the
   process so that Author Domains with more than eight labels do not

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   result in more than eight DNS queries.  Observed data at the time of
   publication showed that Author Domains with up to seven labels were
   in usage, and so eight was chosen as the query limit to allow for
   some future expansion of the name space that did not require updating
   this document.

   The generic steps for a DNS Tree Walk are as follows:

   1.  Query the DNS for a TXT record that matches the format of a DMARC
       Policy Record at the starting point for the Tree Walk.  The
       starting point for the DNS Tree Walk will depend on the ultimate
       target of the DNS Tree Walk.  Section 4.10.1 and Section 4.10.2
       describe the possible starting points.  A possibly empty set of
       records is returned.

   2.  Records that do not start with a "v" tag that identifies the
       current version of DMARC are discarded.  If multiple DMARC Policy
       Records are returned for a single target, they are all discarded.
       If a single record remains and it contains a "psd=n" or "psd=y"
       tag, stop.

   3.  Break the subject DNS domain name into a set of ordered labels.
       Assign the count of labels to "x", and number the labels from
       right to left; e.g., for "a.mail.example.com", "x" would be
       assigned the value 4, "com" would be label 1, "example" would be
       label 2, "mail" would be label 3, and so forth.

   4.  If x < 8, remove the left-most (highest-numbered) label from the
       subject domain.  If x >= 8, remove the left-most (highest-
       numbered) labels from the subject domain until 7 labels remain.
       The resulting DNS domain name is the new target for the next
       lookup.

   5.  Query the DNS for a DMARC Policy Record at the DNS domain name
       matching this new target.  A possibly empty set of records is
       returned.

   6.  Records that do not start with a "v" tag that identifies the
       current version of DMARC are discarded.  If multiple DMARC Policy
       Records are returned for a single target, they are all discarded.
       If a single record remains and it contains a "psd=n" or "psd=y"
       tag, stop.

   7.  Determine the target for the next query by removing the left-most
       label from the target of the previous query.  Repeat steps 5, 6,
       and 7 until the process stops or there are no more labels
       remaining.

   To illustrate, for a message with the arbitrary Author Domain of
   "a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.mail.example.com", a full DNS Tree Walk would
   require the following eight queries to potentially locate the DMARC
   Policy Record or Organizational Domain:

   *  _dmarc.a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.mail.example.com
   *  _dmarc.g.h.i.j.mail.example.com
   *  _dmarc.h.i.j.mail.example.com
   *  _dmarc.i.j.mail.example.com
   *  _dmarc.j.mail.example.com
   *  _dmarc.mail.example.com
   *  _dmarc.example.com
   *  _dmarc.com

4.10.1.  DMARC Policy Discovery

   The DMARC Policy Record to be applied to an email message will be the
   record found at any of the following locations, listed from highest
   preference to lowest:

   *  The Author Domain
   *  The Organizational Domain of the Author Domain
   *  The Public Suffix Domain of the Author Domain

   Policy discovery starts first with a query for a valid DMARC Policy
   Record at the name created by prepending the label "_dmarc" to the
   Author Domain of the message being evaluated.  If a valid DMARC
   Policy Record is found there, then this is the DMARC Policy Record to
   be applied to the message; however, this does not necessarily mean
   that the Author Domain is the Organizational Domain to be used in
   Identifier Alignment checks.  Whether this is also the Organizational
   Domain is dependent on the value of the "psd" tag, if present, or
   some conditions described in Section 4.10.2.

   If no valid DMARC Policy Record is found by the first query, then
   perform a DNS Tree Walk to find the Author Domain's Organizational
   Domain or its Public Suffix Domain.  The starting point for this DNS
   Tree Walk is determined as follows:

   *  If the Author Domain has eight or fewer labels, the starting point
      will be the immediate parent domain of the Author Domain.
   *  Otherwise, the starting point will be the name produced by
      shortening the Author Domain as described starting in step 3 of
      Section 4.10.

   If the DMARC Policy Record to be applied is that of the Author
   Domain, then the Domain Owner Assessment Policy is taken from the "p"
   tag of the record.



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 28]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   If the DMARC Policy Record to be applied is that of either the
   Organizational Domain or the Public Suffix Domain and the Author
   Domain is a subdomain of that domain, then the Domain Owner
   Assessment Policy is taken from the "sp" tag (if any) if the Author
   Domain exists, or the "np" tag (if any) if the Author Domain does not
   exist.  In the absence of applicable "sp" or "np" tags, the "p" tag
   policy is used for subdomains.

   If a retrieved DMARC Policy Record does not contain a valid "p" tag,
   or contains an "sp" or "np" tag that is not valid, then:

   *  If a "rua" tag is present and contains at least one syntactically
      valid reporting URI, the Mail Receiver MUST act as if a record
      containing "p=none" was retrieved and continue processing;

   *  Otherwise, the Mail Receiver applies no DMARC processing to this
      message.

   If the set produced by the DNS Tree Walk contains no DMARC Policy
   Record (i.e., any indication that there is no such record as opposed
   to a transient DNS error), Mail Receivers MUST NOT apply the DMARC
   mechanism to the message.

   Handling of DNS errors when querying for the DMARC Policy Record is
   left to the discretion of the Mail Receiver.  For example, to ensure
   minimal disruption of mail flow, transient errors could result in
   delivery of the message ("fail open"), or they could result in the
   message being temporarily rejected (i.e., an SMTP 4yx reply), which
   invites the sending MTA to try again after the condition has possibly
   cleared, allowing a definite DMARC conclusion to be reached ("fail
   closed").

   Note: PSD policy is not used for Organizational Domains that have
   published a DMARC Policy Record.  Specifically, this is not a
   mechanism to provide feedback addresses (rua/ruf) when an
   Organizational Domain has declined to do so.

4.10.2.  Identifier Alignment Evaluation

   It may be necessary to perform multiple DNS Tree Walks to determine
   if an Authenticated Identifier and an Author Domain are in alignment,
   meaning that they have either the same Organizational Domain (relaxed
   alignment) or that they're identical (strict alignment).  DNS Tree
   Walks done to discover an Organizational Domain for use in Identifier
   Alignment Evaluation might start at any of the following locations:

   *  The Author Domain of the message being evaluated.




Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 29]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   *  The SPF-Authenticated Identifier if there is an SPF pass result
      for the message being evaluated.
   *  Any DKIM-Authenticated Identifier if one or more DKIM pass results
      exist for the message being evaluated.

   Note: There is no need to perform Identifier Alignment Evaluations
   under any of the following conditions:

   *  The Author Domain and the Authenticated Identifier(s) are all the
      same domain, and there is a DMARC Policy Record published for that
      domain.  In this case, this common domain is treated as the
      Organizational Domain.  For example, if the common domain in
      question is "mail.example.com", and there is a valid DMARC Policy
      Record published at "_dmarc.mail.example.com", then
      "mail.example.com" is the Organizational Domain.
   *  No applicable DMARC Policy Record is discovered for the Author
      Domain.  In this case, the DMARC mechanism does not apply to the
      message in question.
   *  The DMARC Policy Record for the Author Domain indicates strict
      alignment.  In this case, a simple string comparison of the Author
      Domain and the Authenticated Identifier(s) is all that is
      required.

   To discover the Organizational Domain for a domain, perform the DNS
   Tree Walk described in Section 4.10 as needed for any of the domains
   in question.

   For each Tree Walk that retrieved valid DMARC Policy Records, select
   the Organizational Domain from the domains for which valid DMARC
   Policy Records were retrieved from the longest to the shortest:

   1.  If a valid DMARC Policy Record contains the "psd" tag set to "n"
       ("psd=n"), this is the Organizational Domain, and the selection
       process is complete.

   2.  If a valid DMARC Policy Record, other than the one for the domain
       where the tree walk started, contains the "psd" tag set to "y"
       ("psd=y"), the Organizational Domain is the domain one label
       below this one in the DNS hierarchy, and the selection process is
       complete.  For example, if in the course of a tree walk a DMARC
       Policy Record is queried for at first "_dmarc.mail.example.com"
       and then "_dmarc.example.com", and a valid DMARC Policy Record
       containing the "psd" tag set to "y" is found at
       "_dmarc.example.com", then "mail.example.com" is the domain one
       label below "example.com" in the DNS hierarchy and is thus the
       Organizational Domain.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   3.  Otherwise, select the DMARC Policy Record found at the name with
       the fewest number of labels.  This is the Organizational Domain
       and the selection process is complete.

   If this process does not determine the Organizational Domain, then
   the initial target domain is the Organizational Domain.

   For example, given the starting domain "a.mail.example.com", a search
   for the Organizational Domain would require a series of DNS queries
   for DMARC Policy Records starting with "_dmarc.a.mail.example.com"
   and finishing with "_dmarc.com".  If there are DMARC Policy Records
   published at "_dmarc.mail.example.com" and "_dmarc.example.com", but
   not at "_dmarc.a.mail.example.com" or "_dmarc.com", then the
   Organizational Domain for this domain would be "example.com".

   As another example, given the starting domain "a.mail.example.com",
   if a search for the Organizational Domain yields a DMARC Policy
   Record at "_dmarc.mail.example.com" with the "psd" tag set to "n",
   then the Organizational Domain for this domain would be
   "mail.example.com".

   As a last example, given the starting domain "a.mail.example.com", if
   a search for the Organizational Domain only yields a DMARC Policy
   Record at "_dmarc.com" and that record contains the tag "psd=y", then
   the Organizational Domain for this domain would be "example.com".

5.  DMARC Participation

   This section describes the actions for participating in DMARC for
   each of three unique entities - Domain Owners, PSOs, and Mail
   Receivers.

5.1.  Domain Owner Actions

   A Domain Owner (#domain-owner) wishing to fully participate in DMARC
   will publish a DMARC Policy Record (#dmarc-policy-record) to cover
   each Author Domain (#author-domain) and corresponding Organizational
   Domain (#organizational-domain) to which DMARC validation should
   apply, send email that produces at least one, and preferably two,
   Authenticated Identifiers (#authenticated-identifiers) that align
   with the Author Domain, will receive and monitor the content of DMARC
   aggregate reports, and will correct any authentication shortcomings
   in mail making authorized use of its domains.

   The following sections describe how to achieve this.






Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


5.1.1.  Publish an SPF Record for an Aligned Domain

   To configure SPF for DMARC, the Domain Owner MUST send mail that has
   an RFC5321.MailFrom domain that will produce an SPF-Authenticated
   Identifier (#spf-identifiers) that has Identifier Alignment
   (#identifier-alignment-explained) with the Author Domain.

5.1.2.  Configure Sending System for DKIM Signing Using an Aligned
        Domain

   To configure DKIM for DMARC, the Domain Owner MUST send mail that has
   a DKIM Signing Domain (#dkim-signing-domain) that will produce a
   DKIM-Authenticated Identifier (#dkim-identifiers) that has Identifier
   Alignment (#identifier-alignment-explained) with the Author Domain.

5.1.3.  Set Up a Mailbox to Receive Aggregate Reports

   Proper consumption and analysis of DMARC aggregate reports are
   essential to any successful DMARC deployment for a Domain Owner.
   DMARC aggregate reports, which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting], contain valuable data for the
   Domain Owner, showing sources of mail using the Author Domain.

5.1.4.  Publish a DMARC Policy Record for the Author Domain and
        Organizational Domain

   Once SPF, DKIM, and the aggregate reports mailbox are all in place,
   it's time to publish a DMARC Policy Record.  For best results, Domain
   Owners usually start with "p=none", (see Section 5.1.5) with the
   "rua" tag containing a URI that references the mailbox created in the
   previous step.  This is commonly referred to as putting the Author
   Domain into Monitoring Mode (#monitoring-mode).  If the
   Organizational Domain is different from the Author Domain, a record
   also needs to be published for the Organizational Domain.

5.1.5.  Collect and Analyze Reports

   The reason for starting at "p=none" is to ensure that nothing's been
   missed in the initial SPF and DKIM deployments.  In all but the most
   trivial setups, a Domain Owner can overlook a server here or be
   unaware of a third party sending agreement there.  Starting at
   "p=none", therefore, takes advantage of DMARC's aggregate reporting
   function, with the Domain Owner using the reports to audit its own
   mail streams' authentication configurations.

   While it is possible for a human to read aggregate reports, they are
   formatted in such a way that it is recommended that they be machine-
   parsed, so setting up a mailbox involves more than just the physical



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 32]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   creation of that mailbox.  Many third-party services exist that will
   process DMARC aggregate reports or the Domain Owner can create its
   own set of tools.  No matter which method is chosen, the ability to
   consume these reports and parse the data contained in them will go a
   long way to ensuring a successful deployment.

5.1.6.  Remediate Unaligned or Unauthenticated Mail Streams

   DMARC aggregate reports can reveal to the Domain Owner mail streams
   using the Author Domain but not passing DMARC validation checks.
   These mail streams may be a combination of illegitimate uses of the
   domain, such as spoofing or other attempted abuse, and legitimate
   uses, as in the case of a mail stream created by an agent of the
   Domain Owner but one with is not passing is due to Authenticated
   Identifiers being unaligned or missing entirely.  For such legitimate
   uses, these shortcomings MUST be addressed prior to any attempt by
   the Domain Owner to publish a Domain Owner Assessment Policy
   (#domain-owner-policy) of Enforcement (#enforcement) for the Author
   Domain.

5.1.7.  Decide Whether to Update Domain Owner Assessment Policy to
        Enforcement

   Once the Domain Owner is satisfied that it is properly authenticating
   all of its mail, then it is time to decide if it is appropriate to
   change its Domain Owner Assessment Policy to Enforcement
   (#enforcement).  Depending on its cadence for sending mail, it may
   take many months of consuming DMARC aggregate reports before a Domain
   Owner reaches the point where it is sure that it is properly
   authenticating all of its mail, and the decision on which "p" value
   to use will depend on its needs.

   In making this decision it is important to understand the
   interoperability issues involved and problems that can result for
   mailing lists and for delivery of legitimate mail.  Those issues are
   discussed in detail in Section 7.4

5.1.8.  A Note on Large, Complex Organizations and Decentralized DNS
        Management

   Large, complex organizations frequently adopt a decentralized model
   for DNS management, whereby management of a subtree of the name space
   is delegated to a local department by the central IT organization.
   In such situations, the "psd" tag makes it possible for those local
   departments to declare any arbitrary node in their subtree as an
   Organizational Domain.  This would be accomplished by publishing a
   DMARC Policy Record at that node with the "psd" tag set to "n".  The
   reasons that departments might declare their own Organizational



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 33]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   Domains include a desire to have different policy settings or
   reporting URIs than the DMARC Policy Record published for the apex
   domain.

   Such configurations would work in theory, and they might involve
   domain names with many labels, reflecting the structure of the
   organization, for example:

   *  Apex domain (DMARC Policy Record published here): example.com
   *  Zone cut domain (DMARC Policy Record with "psd=n" published here):
      b.c.d.e.f.g.example.com
   *  Author Domain: mail.a.b.c.d.e.f.g.example.com

   However, Domain Owners should be aware that due to the anti-abuse
   protections built into the DNS Tree Walk (#dns-tree-walk), the DMARC
   Policy Record published at the zone cut domain in this example will
   never be discovered.  A Mail Receiver performing a Tree Walk would
   only perform queries for these names:

   *  _dmarc.mail.a.b.c.d.e.f.g.example.com
   *  _dmarc.c.d.e.f.g.example.com
   *  _dmarc.d.e.f.g.example.com
   *  _dmarc.e.f.g.example.com
   *  _dmarc.f.g.example.com
   *  _dmarc.g.example.com
   *  _dmarc.example.com
   *  _dmarc.com

   To avoid this circumstance, Domain Owners wishing to have a specific
   DMARC Policy Record applied to a given [Author Domain]{#author-
   domain) longer than eight labels MUST publish a DMARC Policy Record
   at that domain's location in the DNS namespace, as such records are
   always queried by Mail Receivers that participate in DMARC before the
   Tree Walk begins.  In the above example, this would mean publishing a
   DMARC Policy Record at the name
   "_dmarc.mail.a.b.c.d.e.f.g.example.com.".

5.2.  PSO Actions

   In addition to the DMARC Domain Owner actions, if a PSO (#public-
   suffix-operator) publishes a DMARC Policy Record it MUST include the
   "psd" tag (see Section 4.7) with a value of "y" ("psd=y").

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


5.3.  Mail Receiver Actions

   Mail Receivers (#mail-receiver) wishing to fully participate in DMARC
   will apply the DMARC mechanism to inbound email messages when a DMARC
   Policy Record (#dmarc-policy-record) exists that applies to the
   Author Domain (#author-domain), and will send aggregate feedback
   reports to Domain Owners that request them.  Mail Receivers might
   also send failure reports to Domain Owners that request them.  The
   following sections describe how to achieve this.

   The steps for applying the DMARC mechanism to an email message can
   take place during the SMTP transaction, and should do so if the Mail
   Receiver plans to honor Domain Owner Assessment Policies (#domain-
   owner-policy) that are at the Enforcement (#enforcement) state.

   Many Mail Receivers perform one or both of the underlying
   Authentication Mechanisms (#authentication-mechanisms) on inbound
   messages even in cases where no DMARC Policy Record exists for the
   Author Domain of a given message, or where the Mail Receiver is not
   participating in DMARC.  Nothing in this section is intended to imply
   that the underlying Authentication Mechanisms should only be
   performed by Mail Receivers participating in DMARC.

5.3.1.  Extract Author Domain

   Once the email message has been transmitted to the Mail Receiver, the
   Mail Receiver extracts the domain in the RFC5322.From header field as
   the Author Domain.  If the domain is a U-label, the domain MUST be
   converted to an A-label, as described in Section 2.3 of [RFC5890],
   for further processing.

   If zero or more than one domain is extracted from the RFC5322.From
   header field, then DMARC validation is not possible and the process
   terminates.  In the case where more than one domain is retrieved, the
   Mail Receiver MAY choose to go forward with DMARC validation anyway.
   See Section 11.5 for further discussion.

5.3.2.  Determine If The DMARC Mechanism Applies

   If precisely one Author Domain exists for the message, then perform
   the step described in DMARC Policy Discovery (#dmarc-policy-
   discovery) to determine if the DMARC mechanism applies.  If a DMARC
   Policy Record (#dmarc-policy-record) is not discovered during this
   step, then the DMARC mechanism does not apply and DMARC validation
   terminates for the message.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


5.3.3.  Determine If Authenticated Identifiers Exist

   For each Authentication Mechanism underlying DMARC, perform the
   required check to determine if an Authenticated Identifier
   (#authenticated-identifier) exists for the message if such check has
   not already been performed.  Results from each check must be
   preserved for later use as follows:

   *  For SPF, the preserved results MUST include "pass" or "fail", and
      if "fail", SHOULD include information about the reasons for
      failure if available.  The results MUST further include the domain
      name used to complete the SPF check.
   *  For DKIM signature validation checks, for each signature checked,
      the results MUST include "pass" or "fail", and if "fail", SHOULD
      include information about the reasons for failure.  The results
      MUST further include the value of the "d" and "s" tags from each
      checked DKIM signature.

5.3.4.  Conduct Identifier Alignment Checks If Necessary

   For each Authenticated Identifier found in the message, the Mail
   Receiver checks to see if the Authenticated Identifier is aligned
   (#identifier-alignment-evaluation) with the Author Domain.

5.3.5.  Determine DMARC "Pass" or "Fail"

   If one or more of the Authenticated Identifiers align with the Author
   Domain, the message is considered to pass the DMARC mechanism check.

   If no Authenticated Identifiers exist for the domain, or none of the
   Authenticated Identifiers align with the Author Domain, the message
   is considered to fail the DMARC mechanism check.

5.3.6.  Apply Policy If Appropriate

   Email messages that fail the DMARC mechanism check are handled in
   accordance with the Mail Receiver's local policies.  These local
   policies may take into account the Domain Owner Assessment Policy for
   the Author Domain at the Mail Receiver's discretion.

   If one or more DNS queries required to perform DMARC validation on
   the message do not complete due to temporary or permanent DNS errors,
   the message cannot be considered to pass or fail the DMARC mechanism
   check.  In such cases, the Domain Owner Assessment Policy cannot be
   applied to the message, and any other handling decisions for the
   message are left to the discretion of the Mail Receiver.

   See Section 7.2 for further discussion of topics regarding rejecting
   messages.

5.3.7.  Store Results of DMARC Processing

   If the Mail Receiver intends to send aggregate feedback reports and/
   or failure reports, then results obtained from the application of the
   DMARC mechanism by the Mail Receiver MUST be preserved for eventual
   presentation back to the Domain Owner in the form of such reports.
   Section 4.7 and [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] discuss
   aggregate feedback reports.

5.3.8.  Send Aggregate Reports

   To ensure maximum usefulness for DMARC across the email ecosystem,
   Mail Receivers SHOULD generate and send aggregate reports with a
   frequency of at least once every 24 hours.  Such reports provide
   Domain Owners with insight into all mail streams using Author Domains
   under the Domain Owner's control, and aid the Domain Owner in
   determining whether and when to transition from Monitoring Mode
   (#monitoring-mode) to Enforcement (#enforcement).

   The most common reasons for a Mail Receiver to opt out of sending
   aggregate reports include resource constraints, local policy against
   sharing data, and concerns about user privacy.

5.3.9.  Optionally Send Failure Reports

   Per-message failure reports can be a useful source of information for
   a Domain Owner, either for debugging deployments or in analyzing
   attacks, and so Mail Receivers MAY choose to send them.  Experience
   has shown, however, that Mail Receivers rightly concerned about
   protecting user privacy have either chosen to heavily redact the
   information in such reports (which can hinder their usefulness) or
   not send them at all.  See [I-D.ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting] for
   further information.

5.4.  Policy Enforcement Considerations

   The final handling of any message is always a matter of local policy
   and is left to the discretion of the Mail Receiver.

   A DMARC pass for a message indicates only that the use of the Author
   Domain (#author-domain) has been validated for that message as
   authorized by the Domain Owner (#domain-owner).  Such authorization
   does not carry an explicit or implicit value assertion about that
   message or the Domain Owner, and Mail Receivers MAY choose to reject
   or quarantine a message even if it passes the DMARC validation check.
   Mail Receivers are encouraged to maintain anti-abuse technologies to
   combat the possibility of DMARC-enabled criminal campaigns.

   Mail Receivers MAY choose to accept email that fails the DMARC
   validation check even if the published Domain Owner Assessment Policy
   is "reject".  In particular, because of the considerations discussed
   in [RFC7960] and in Section 7.4 of this document, it is important
   that Mail Receivers SHOULD NOT reject messages solely because of a
   published policy of "reject", but that they apply other knowledge and
   analysis to avoid situations such as rejection of legitimate messages
   sent in ways that DMARC cannot describe, harm to the operation of
   mailing lists, and similar.

   If a Mail Receiver chooses not to honor the published Domain Owner
   Assessment Policy to improve interoperability among mail systems, it
   may increase the likelihood of accepting abusive mail.  At a minimum,
   Mail Receivers SHOULD add the Authentication-Results header field
   (see [RFC8601]), and it is RECOMMENDED when delivering messages that
   fail the DMARC validation check.

   When Mail Receivers deviate from a published Domain Owner Assessment
   Policy during message processing they SHOULD make available the fact
   of and reason for the deviation to the Domain Owner via feedback
   reporting, specifically using the "PolicyOverride" feature of the
   aggregate report defined in [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

   To enable Domain Owners to receive DMARC feedback without impacting
   existing mail processing, discovered policies of "p=none" MUST NOT
   modify existing mail handling processes.

6.  DMARC Feedback

   DMARC Feedback is described in [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting]

   As an operational note for Public Suffix Operators, feedback for non-
   existent domains can be desirable and useful, just as it can be for
   Organizational Domains.  Therefore, both such entities should
   consider including "rua=" tags in any DMARC Policy Records they
   publish for themselves.  See Section 10 for discussion of Privacy
   Considerations.

7.  Other Topics

   This section discusses some topics regarding choices made in the
   development of DMARC, largely to commit the history to record.

7.1.  Issues Specific to SPF

   Though DMARC does not inherently change the semantics of an SPF
   policy record, historically lax enforcement of such policies has led
   many to publish extremely broad records containing many extensive
   network ranges.  Domain Owners (#domain-owner) are strongly
   encouraged to carefully review their SPF records to understand which
   networks are authorized to send on behalf of the Domain Owner before
   publishing a DMARC Policy Record.  Furthermore, Domain Owners should
   periodically review their SPF records to ensure that the
   authorization conveyed by the records matches the domain's current
   needs.

   SPF was intended to be implemented early in the SMTP transaction,
   meaning it's possible for a message to fail SPF validation prior to
   any message content being transmitted, and so some Mail Receiver
   architectures might implement SPF in advance of any DMARC operations.
   This means that an SPF hard fail ("-") prefix on a sender's SPF
   mechanism, such as "-all", could cause a message to be rejected early
   in the SMTP transaction, before any DMARC processing takes place, if
   the message fails SPF authentication checks.  Domain Owners choosing
   to use "-all" to terminate SPF records should be aware of this, and
   should understand that messages that might otherwise pass DMARC due
   to an aligned DKIM-Authenticated Identifier (#dkim-identifiers) could
   be rejected solely due to an SPF fail.  Moreover, messages rejected
   early in the SMTP transaction will never appear in aggregate DMARC
   reports, as the transaction will never proceed to the DATA phase and
   so the RFC5322.From domain will never be revealed and its DMARC
   policy will never be discovered.  Domain Owners and Mail Receivers
   (#mail-receiver) can consult [M3SPF] and [M3AUTH] for more discussion
   of the topic and best practices regarding publishing SPF records and
   when to reject based solely on SPF failure:

7.2.  Rejecting Messages

   The DMARC mechanism calls for rejection of a message during the SMTP
   session under certain circumstances.  This is preferable to
   generation of a Delivery Status Notification [RFC3464], since
   fraudulent messages caught and rejected using the DMARC mechanism
   would then result in the annoying generation of such failure reports
   that go back to the RFC5321.MailFrom address.

   This synchronous rejection is typically done in one of two ways:



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 39]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   *  Full rejection, wherein the SMTP server issues a 5xy reply code to
      the DATA command as an indication to the SMTP client that the
      transaction failed; the SMTP client is then responsible for
      generating a notification that delivery failed (see Section 4.2.5
      of [RFC5321]).

   *  A "silent discard", wherein the SMTP server returns a 2xy reply
      code implying to the client that delivery (or, at least, relay)
      was successfully completed, but then simply discards the message
      with no further action.

   Each of these has a cost.  For instance, a silent discard can help to
   prevent backscatter, but it also effectively means that the SMTP
   server has to be programmed to give a false result, which can
   confound external debugging efforts.

   Similarly, the text portion of the SMTP reply may be important to
   consider.  For example, when rejecting a message, revealing the
   reason for the rejection might give an attacker enough information to
   bypass those efforts on a later attempt, though it might also assist
   a legitimate client to determine the source of some local issue that
   caused the rejection.

   In the latter case, when doing an SMTP rejection, providing a clear
   hint can be useful in resolving issues.  A Mail Receiver (#mail-
   receiver) might indicate in plain text the reason for the rejection
   by using the word "DMARC" somewhere in the reply text.  For example:

   550 5.7.1 Email rejected per DMARC policy for example.com

   Many systems are able to scan the SMTP reply text to determine the
   nature of the rejection.  Thus, providing a machine-detectable reason
   for rejection allows the problems causing rejections to be properly
   addressed by automated systems.

   If a Mail Receiver elects to defer delivery due to the inability to
   retrieve or apply DMARC policy, this is best done with a 4xy SMTP
   reply code.

7.3.  Interoperability Issues

   DMARC limits which end-to-end scenarios can achieve a "pass" result.

   Because DMARC relies on SPF [RFC7208] and/or DKIM [RFC6376] to
   achieve a "pass", their limitations also apply.

   Issues specific to the use of policy mechanisms alongside DKIM are
   further discussed in [RFC6377], particularly Section 5.2.



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 40]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   Mail that is sent by authorized, independent third parties might not
   be sent with Identifier Alignment, also preventing a "pass" result.
   A Domain Owner can use DMARC aggregate reports to identify this mail
   and take steps to address authentication shortcomings.

7.4.  Interoperability Considerations

   As discussed in "Interoperability Issues between DMARC and Indirect
   Email Flows" [RFC7960], use of "p=reject" can be incompatible with
   and cause interoperability problems to indirect message flows such as
   "alumni forwarders", role-based email aliases, and mailing lists
   across the Internet.

   As an example of this, a bank might send only targeted messages to
   account holders.  Those account holders might have given their bank
   addresses such as "jones@alumni.example.edu" (an address that relays
   the messages to another address with a real mailbox) or
   "finance@association.example" (a role-based address that does similar
   relaying for the current head of finance at the association).  When
   such mail is delivered to the actual recipient mailbox, it will most
   likely fail SPF checks unless the RFC5321.MailFrom address is
   rewritten by the relaying MTA, as the incoming IP address will be
   that of "example.edu" or "association.example", and not an IP address
   authorized by the originating RFC5321.MailFrom domain.  DKIM
   signatures will generally remain valid in these relay situations.

   |  It is therefore critical that domains that publish "p=reject" MUST
   |  NOT rely solely on SPF to secure a DMARC pass, and MUST apply
   |  valid DKIM signatures to their messages.

   In the case of domains that have general users who send routine
   email, those that publish a Domain Owner Assessment Policy (#domain-
   owner-policy) of "p=reject" are likely to create significant
   interoperability issues.  In particular, if users in such domains
   post messages to mailing lists on the Internet, those messages can
   cause significant operational problems for the mailing lists and for
   the subscribers to those lists, as explained below and in [RFC7960].














Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 41]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   |  It is therefore critical that domains that host users who might
   |  post messages to mailing lists SHOULD NOT publish Domain Owner
   |  Assessment Policies of "p=reject".  Any such domains wishing to
   |  publish "p=reject" SHOULD first take advantage of DMARC aggregate
   |  report data for their domain to determine the possible impact to
   |  their users, first by publishing "p=none" for at least a month,
   |  followed by publishing "p=quarantine" for an equally long period
   |  of time, and comparing the message disposition results.  Domains
   |  that choose to publish "p=reject" SHOULD either implement policies
   |  that their users not post to Internet mailing lists and/or inform
   |  their users that their participation in mailing lists may be
   |  hindered.

   As noted in Section 5.4, Mail Receivers (#mail-receivers) need to
   apply more analysis than just DMARC validation in their disposition
   of incoming messages.  An example of the consequences of honoring a
   Domain Owner Assessment Policy of "p=reject" without further analysis
   is that rejecting messages that have been relayed by a mailing list
   can cause the Mail Receiver's users to have their subscriptions to
   that mailing list canceled by the list software's automated handling
   of such rejections - it looks to the list manager as though the
   recipient's email address is no longer working, so the address is
   automatically unsubscribed.  An example of this scenario, albeit with
   DKIM Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP) rather than DMARC, can be
   found in Section 5.2 of [RFC6377].

   |  It is therefore critical that Mail Receivers MUST NOT reject
   |  incoming messages solely on the basis of a "p=reject" policy by
   |  the sending domain.  Mail Receivers must use the DMARC policy as
   |  part of their disposition decision, along with other knowledge and
   |  analysis.  "Other knowledge and analysis" here might refer to
   |  observed sending patterns for properly-authenticated mail using
   |  the sending domain, content filtering, etc.  In the absence of
   |  other knowledge and analysis, Mail Receivers MUST treat such
   |  failing mail as if the policy were "p=quarantine" rather than
   |  "p=reject".

   Failure to understand and abide by these considerations can cause
   legitimate, sometimes important email to be rejected, can cause
   operational damage to mailing lists throughout the Internet, and can
   result in trouble-desk calls and complaints from the Mail Receiver's
   employees, customers, and clients.

   In practice, despite this advice, few Mail Receivers apply any
   mitigation techniques when receiving indirect mail flows, few
   organizations consider the effect of DMARC policies on their users'
   indirect mail, and it is unlikely that any advice in this document
   will change that.  As a result, mail forwarded through mailing lists
   with unmodified From: header lines is frequently rejected due to a
   p=reject policy.

   In the ten years since large consumer mail systems started publishing
   p=reject policies, mailing list software has all adopted workarounds
   to make the From: header line DMARC aligned.  Some simply use the
   list's address, while others do per-address modifications intended to
   be reversible or to allow mail to be forwarded back to the original
   author, e.g., bob@example.com turned into
   bob=example.com@user.somelist.example.  While these workarounds are
   far from ideal, they are firmly established and list operators treat
   them as a fact of life.

   Mail developers have been trying for a decade to invent technical
   methods to allow mailing lists to continue to work without modifying
   the From: header line, with a prominent example being the
   Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol described in [RFC8617].
   While work continues, as of this document's publication, none of the
   methods have become widely used.  Should such a technical method
   achieve widespread adoption in the future, this document can be
   updated to reflect that.

8.  Conformance Requirements for Full DMARC Participation

   This document describes the DMARC mechanism, and allows Domain Owners
   and Mail Receivers some leeway in deciding which parts of the
   mechanism to implement.  This section summarizes the requirements for
   full participation in DMARC, either by Domain Owners or by Mail
   Receivers.

   In order to fully participate in DMARC, Domain Owners:

   *  MUST send mail so it produces an SPF-Authenticated identifier that
      has Identifier Alignment with the Author Domain
   *  MUST send mail that has a DKIM Signing Domain that will produce a
      DKIM-Authenticated Identifier that has Identifier Alignment with
      the Author Domain
   *  MUST set up a mailbox to receive aggregate reports and collect and
      analyze those reports
   *  MUST publish a DMARC Policy Record for the Author Domain and the
      Organizational Domain, if it differs from the Author Domain
   *  MUST NOT rely solely on SPF for a DMARC pass if the DMARC policy
      for the Author Domain is "p=reject"

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   In order to fully participate in DMARC, Mail Receivers

   *  MUST check for the existence of a DMARC Policy Record for the
      Author Domain of an inbound mail message to determine if the DMARC
      mechanism applies to that message.
   *  MUST determine if Authenticated Identifiers exist for the message
      and preserve the results of those checks for future use in
      reportging if the DMARC mechanism applies to the message
   *  MUST conduct necessary Identifier Alignmeent checks if the DMARC
      mechanism applies for the message and Authenticated Identifiers
      exist
   *  MUST use the information from the checks for Authenticated
      Identifiers to determine if the DMARC validation result is "pass"
      or "fail" for the message.
   *  MUST support the "mailto:" URI for sending requested reports
   *  SHOULD send aggregate reports on at least a daily basis
   *  MUST NOT reject messages solely on the basis of a "p=reject"
      policy for the Author Domain

9.3.  DMARC Tag Registry

   A registry tree called "Domain-based Message Authentication,
   Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) Parameters" exists, and it and any
   sub-registries thereunder should be updated to reference this
   document.  Within it, a new sub-registry called the "DMARC Tag
   Registry" exists.

   Names of DMARC tags are registered with IANA in this sub-registry.
   Entries are assigned only for values that have been documented in a
   manner that satisfies the terms of Specification Required, per
   [RFC8126].  Each registration includes the tag name; the
   specification that defines it; a brief description; and its status,
   which is one of "current", "experimental", or "historic".  The
   Designated Expert needs to confirm that the provided specification
   adequately describes the new tag and clearly presents how it would be
   used within the DMARC context by Domain Owners and Mail Receivers.

   To avoid version compatibility issues, tags added to the DMARC
   specification are to avoid changing the semantics of existing records
   when processed by implementations conforming to prior specifications.

   The set of entries to be defined in this registry is as follows:

9.4.  DMARC Report Format Registry

   Also, within "Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and
   Conformance (DMARC) Parameters", a new sub-registry called "DMARC
   Report Format Registry" exists and should be updated to reference
   this document.

   Names of DMARC failure reporting formats are registered with IANA in
   this registry.  New entries are assigned only for values that satisfy
   the definition of Specification Required, per [RFC8126].  In addition
   to a reference to a permanent specification, each registration
   includes the format name, a brief description, and its status, which
   must be one of "current", "experimental", or "historic".  The
   Designated Expert needs to confirm that the provided specification
   adequately describes the report format and clearly presents how it
   would be used within the DMARC context by Domain Owners and Mail
   Receivers.

   The entry in this registry is as follows:

10.  Privacy Considerations

   This section discusses issues specific to private data that may be
   included if DMARC reports are requested.  Issues associated with
   sending aggregate reports and failure reports are addressed in
   [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] and
   [I-D.ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting] respectively.

10.1.  Aggregate Report Considerations

   Aggregate reports may, particularly for small organizations, provide
   some limited insight into email sending patterns.  As an example, in
   a small organization, an aggregate report from a particular domain
   may be sufficient to make the Report Consumer aware of sensitive
   personal or business information.  If setting an "rua" tag in a DMARC
   Policy Record, the reporting address needs controls appropriate to
   the organizational requirements to mitigate any risk associated with
   receiving and handling reports.

   In the case of "rua" requests for multi-organizational PSDs,
   additional information leakage considerations exist.  Multi-
   organizational PSDs that do not mandate DMARC use by registrants risk
   exposure of private data of registrant domains if they include the
   "rua" tag in their DMARC Policy Record.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


10.2.  Failure Report Considerations

   Failure reports do provide insight into email sending patterns,
   including specific users.  If requesting failure reports, data
   management controls are needed to support appropriate management of
   this information.  The additional detail available through failure
   reports (relative to aggregate reports) can drive a need for
   additional controls.  As an example, a company may be legally
   restricted from receiving data related to a specific subsidiary.
   Before requesting failure reports, any such data spillage risks have
   to be addressed through data management controls or publishing DMARC
   Policy Records for relevant subdomains to prevent reporting on data
   related to their emails.

   Due to the nature of the email contents which may be shared through
   Failure Reports, most Mail Receivers refuse to send them out of
   privacy concerns.  Out of band agreements between Report Consumers
   and Mail Receivers may be required to address these concerns.

   DMARC Policy Records for multi-organizational PSDs MUST NOT include
   the "ruf" tag.

11.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security issues and possible remediations
   (where available) for DMARC.

11.1.  Authentication Methods

   Security considerations from the authentication methods used by DMARC
   are incorporated here by reference.

   Both of the email authentication methods that underlie DMARC provide
   some assurance that an email was transmitted by an MTA which is
   authorized to do so.  SPF policies map domain names to sets of
   authorized MTAs (see Section 11.4 of [RFC7208]).  Validated DKIM
   signatures indicate that an email was transmitted by an MTA with
   access to a private key that matches the published DKIM key record.

   Whenever mail is sent, there is a risk that an overly permissive
   source may send mail that will receive a DMARC pass result that was
   not, in fact, intended by the Domain Owner.  These results may lead
   to issues when systems interpret DMARC pass results to indicate a
   message is in some way authentic.  They also allow such unauthorized
   senders to evade the Domain Owner's intended message handling for
   DMARC validation failures.





Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 49]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   To avoid this risk one must ensure that no unauthorized source can
   add DKIM signatures to the domain's mail or transmit mail which will
   evaluate as SPF pass.  If, nonetheless, a Domain Owner wishes to
   include a permissive source in a domain's SPF record, the source can
   be excluded from DMARC consideration by using the "?" qualifier on
   the SPF record mechanism associated with that source.  The DMARC
   working group had a lively discussion about possibly eliminating SPF
   entirely as an underlying Authentication Mechanism for DMARC, but
   consensus was not reached, and the suggestion to use the "?"
   qualifier for permissive sources is presented here instead.

11.2.  Attacks on Reporting URIs

   URIs published in DNS TXT records are well-understood possible
   targets for attack.  Specifications such as [RFC1035] and [RFC2142]
   either expose or cause the exposure of email addresses that could be
   flooded by an attacker, for example.  Records found in the DNS such
   as MX, NS, and others advertise potential attack destinations.
   Common DNS names such as "www" plainly identify the locations at
   which particular services can be found, providing destinations for
   targeted denial-of-service or penetration attacks.  This all means
   that Domain Owners will need to harden these addresses against
   various attacks, including but not limited to:

   *  high-volume denial-of-service attacks;

   *  deliberate construction of malformed reports intended to identify
      or exploit parsing or processing vulnerabilities;

   *  deliberate construction of reports containing false claims for the
      Submitter or Reported-Domain fields, including the possibility of
      false data from compromised but known Mail Receivers.

11.3.  DNS Security

   The DMARC mechanism and its underlying Authentication Mechanisms (SPF
   and DKIM) depend on the security of the DNS.  Examples of how hostile
   parties can have an adverse impact on DNS traffic include:

   *  If they can snoop on DNS traffic, they can get an idea of who is
      receiving mail using the domain(s) in question.

   *  If they can block outgoing or reply DNS messages, they can prevent
      systems from discovering senders' DMARC policies.

   *  If they can send forged response packets, they can make aligned
      mail appear unaligned or vice-versa.




Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 50]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   None of these threats are unique to DMARC, and they can be addressed
   using a variety of techniques, including, but not limited to:

   *  Signing DNS records with Domain Name System Security Extensions
      (DNSSEC) [RFC4033], which enables recipients to validate the
      integrity of DNS data and detect and discard forged responses.

   *  DNS over TLS [RFC7858] or DNS over HTTPS [RFC8484] can mitigate
      snooping and forged responses.

11.4.  Display Name Attacks

   An increasingly common attack in messaging abuse is the presentation
   of false information in the display-name portion of the RFC5322.From
   header field.  For example, it is possible for the email address in
   that field to be an arbitrary address or domain name while containing
   a well-known name (a person, brand, role, etc.) in the display name,
   intending to fool the end user into believing that the name is used
   legitimately.

   Such attacks, known as display name attacks, are out of scope for
   DMARC.

11.5.  Denial of DMARC Processing Attacks

   The declaration in Section 5.3.1 and elsewhere in this document that
   messages that do not contain precisely one RFC5322.From domain are
   outside the scope of this document exposes an attack vector that must
   be taken into consideration.

   Because such messages are outside the scope of this document, an
   attacker can craft messages with multiple RFC5322.From domains,
   including the spoofed domain, in an effort to bypass DMARC validation
   and get the fraudulent message to be displayed by the victim's MUA
   with the spoofed domain successfully shown to the victim.  In those
   cases where such messages are not rejected due to other reasons (for
   example, many such messages would violate RFC5322's requirement that
   there be precisely one From: header field), care must be taken by the
   Mail Receiver to recognize such messages as the threats they might be
   and handle them appropriately.

   The case of a syntactically valid multi-valued RFC5322.From field
   presents a particular challenge.  Experience has shown that most such
   messages are abusive and/or unwanted by their recipients, and given
   this fact, a Mail Receiver may make a negative disposition decision
   for the message prior to and instead of its being subjected to DMARC
   processing.  However, in a case where a Mail Receiver requires that
   the message be subject to DMARC validation, a recommended approach as



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 51]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   per [RFC7489] is to apply the DMARC mechanism to each domain found in
   the RFC5322.From field as the Author Domain and apply the most strict
   policy selected among the checks that fail.  Such an approach might
   prove useful for a small number of Author Domains, but it is possible
   that applying such logic to messages with a large number of domains
   (where "large" is defined by each Mail Receiver) will expose the Mail
   Receiver to a form of denial of service attack.  Limiting the number
   of Author Domains processed will avoid this risk.  If not all Author
   Domains are processed, then the DMARC evaluation is incomplete.

11.6.  External Reporting Addresses

   To avoid abuse by bad actors, reporting addresses generally have to
   be inside the domains about which reports are requested.  To
   accommodate special cases such as a need to get reports about domains
   that cannot actually receive mail, Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] describes a DNS-based mechanism
   for validating approved external reporting.

   The obvious consideration here is an increased DNS load against
   domains that are claimed as external recipients.  Negative caching
   will mitigate this problem, but only to a limited extent, mostly
   dependent on the default TTL in the domain's SOA record.

   Where possible, external reporting is best achieved by having the
   report be directed to domains that can receive mail and simply having
   it automatically forwarded to the desired external destination.

   Note that the addresses shown in the "ruf" tag receive more
   information that might be considered private data since it is
   possible for actual email content to appear in the failure reports.
   The URIs identified there are thus more attractive targets for
   intrusion attempts than those found in the "rua" tag.  Moreover,
   attacking the DNS of the subject domain to cause failure data to be
   routed fraudulently to an attacker's systems may be an attractive
   prospect.  Deployment of DNSSEC [RFC4033] is advisable if this is a
   concern.

11.7.  Secure Protocols

   This document encourages the use of secure transport mechanisms to
   prevent the loss of private data to third parties that may be able to
   monitor such transmissions.  Unencrypted mechanisms should be
   avoided.

   In particular, a message that was originally encrypted or otherwise
   secured might appear in a report that is not sent securely, which
   could reveal private information.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


11.8.  Relaxed Alignment Considerations

   The DMARC mechanism allows both DKIM- and SPF-Authenticated
   Identifiers (#identifier-alignment-explained) to validate authorized
   use of an Author Domain (#author-domain) on behalf of a Domain Owner
   (#domain-owner).  If malicious or unaware users can gain control of
   the SPF record or DKIM selector records for a subdomain of the
   Organizational Domain, the subdomain can be used to generate email
   that achieves a DMARC pass on behalf of the Organizational Domain.

   A scenario such as this could occur under the following conditions:

   *  A DMARC Policy Record exists for the domain "example.com", such
      that "example.com" is an Organizational Domain
   *  An attacker controls DNS for the domain "evil.example.com" and
      publishes an SPF record for that domain
   *  The attacker sends email with RFC5322.From header field containing
      "foo@example.com" and an SPF-Authenticated Identifier of
      "evil.example.com"

   Although this email was not authorized by the Domain Owner, it can
   produce a DMARC pass because the SPF-Authenticated Identifier
   ("evil.example.com") has Identifier Alignment with the Author Domain
   ("example.com").

   The Organizational Domain Owner should be careful not to delegate
   control of subdomains if this is an issue, and consider using the
   Strict Alignment (#strict-alignment) option if appropriate.

   DMARC evaluation for relaxed alignment is also highly sensitive to
   errors in determining the Organizational Domain if the Author Domain
   does not have a published DMARC Policy Record (#dmarc-policy-record).
   If an incorrectly selected Organizational Domain is a parent of the
   correct Organizational Domain, then relaxed alignment could
   potentially allow a malicious sender to send mail that achieves a
   DMARC pass verdict.  This potential exists for both the legacy
   [RFC7489] and current methods for determining the organizational
   domain, the latter described in Section 4.10.2.

   The following example illustrates this possibility:

   *  Mail is sent with an Author Domain of "a.mail.example.com" and
      Authenticated Identifiers of "mail.example.com"
   *  There is no DMARC Policy Record published at
      "_dmarc.a.mail.example.com"
   *  There is one published at "_dmarc.mail.example.com" and this is
      intended to be the Organizational Domain for this message




Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 53]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   *  There is also a DMARC Policy Record published at
      "_dmarc.example.com", with default alignment (relaxed)
   *  An is able to send mail with the Author Domain of
      "evil.example.com" and an Authenticated Identifier of
      "mail.example.com"

   In this scenario, if a Mail Receiver incorrectly determines the
   Organizational Domain to be "example.com", then the attacker's mail
   will pass DMARC validation checks.

   This issue is entirely avoided by the use of Strict Alignment and
   publishing explicit DMARC Policy Records for all Author Domains used
   in an organization's email.

   For cases where Strict Alignment is not appropriate, this issue can
   be mitigated by the Domain Owner periodically (perhaps weekly, or
   whatever frequency might be appropriate for a given organization's
   operational needs) checking the DMARC Policy Records, if any, of PSDs
   (#public-suffix-domain) above the Organizational Domain in the DNS
   tree and (for legacy [RFC7489] checking that appropriate PSL entries
   remain present).  If a PSD publishes a DMARC Policy Record without
   the appropriate "psd=y" tag, Organizational Domain owners can add
   "psd=n" to their Organizational Domain's DMARC Policy Record so that
   the PSD's DMARC Policy Record will not be incorrectly interpreted to
   indicate that the PSD is the Organizational Domain.

Appendix A.  Technology Considerations

   This section documents some design decisions made in the development
   of DMARC.  Specifically addressed here are some suggestions that were
   considered but not included in the design, with explanatory text
   regarding the decision.

A.1.  S/MIME

   S/MIME, or Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions [RFC8551], is
   a standard for encrypting and signing MIME data in a message.  This
   was suggested and considered as a third security protocol for
   authenticating the source of a message.

   DMARC is focused on authentication at the domain level (i.e., the
   Domain Owner taking responsibility for the message), while S/MIME is
   really intended for user-to-user authentication and encryption.  This
   alone appears to make it a bad fit for DMARC's goals.









Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 58]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   S/MIME also suffers from the heavyweight problem of Public Key
   Infrastructure, which means that distribution of keys used to
   validate signatures needs to be incorporated.  In many instances,
   this alone is a showstopper.  There have been consistent promises
   that PKI usability and deployment will improve, but these have yet to
   materialize.  DMARC can revisit this choice after those barriers are
   addressed.

   S/MIME has extensive deployment in specific market segments
   (government, for example) but does not enjoy similar widespread
   deployment over the general Internet, and this shows no signs of
   changing.  DKIM and SPF are both deployed widely over the general
   Internet, and their adoption rates continue to be positive.

   Finally, experiments have shown that including S/MIME support in the
   initial version of DMARC would neither cause nor enable a substantial
   increase in the accuracy of the overall mechanism.

A.2.  Method Exclusion

   It was suggested that DMARC include a mechanism by which a Domain
   Owner could instruct Mail Receivers not to attempt validation by one
   of the supported methods (e.g., "check DKIM, but not SPF").

   Specifically, consider a Domain Owner that has deployed one of the
   technologies and that technology fails for some messages, but such
   failures don't cause enforcement action.  Deploying DMARC would cause
   enforcement action for policies other than "none", which would appear
   to exclude participation by that Domain Owner.

   The DMARC development team evaluated the idea of policy exception
   mechanisms on several occasions and invariably concluded that there
   was not a strong enough use case to include them.  The target
   audience for DMARC does not appear to have concerns about the failure
   modes of one or the other being a barrier to DMARC's adoption.

   In the scenario described above, the Domain Owner has a few options:

   1.  Tighten up its infrastructure to minimize the failure modes of
       the single deployed technology.

   2.  Deploy the other supported authentication mechanism, to offset
       the failure modes of the first.

   3.  Deploy DMARC in a reporting-only mode.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


A.3.  Sender Header Field

   It has been suggested in several message authentication efforts that
   the Sender header field be checked for an identifier of interest, as
   the standards indicate this as the proper way to indicate a re-
   mailing of content such as through a mailing list.  Most recently, it
   was a protocol-level option for DomainKeys [RFC4870], but on
   evolution to DKIM, this property was removed.

   The DMARC development team considered this and decided not to include
   support for doing so for the following reasons:

   1.  The main user protection approach is to be concerned with what
       the user sees when a message is rendered.  There is no consistent
       behavior among MUAs regarding what to do with the content of the
       Sender field, if present.  Accordingly, supporting the checking
       of the Sender identifier would mean applying policy to an
       identifier the end user might never actually see, which can
       create a vector for attack against end users by simply forging a
       Sender field containing some identifier that DMARC will like.

   2.  Although it is certainly true that this is what the Sender field
       is for, its use in this way is also unreliable, making it a poor
       candidate for inclusion in the DMARC evaluation algorithm.

   3.  Allowing multiple ways to discover policy introduces unacceptable
       ambiguity into the DMARC validation algorithm in terms of which
       policy is to be applied and when.

A.4.  Domain Existence Test

   The presence of the "np" tag in this specification seemingly implies
   that there would be an agreed-upon standard for determining a
   domain's existence.

   Since the DMARC mechanism is focused on email, one might think that
   the definition of "resolvable" in [RFC5321] applies.  Using that
   definition, only names that resolve to MX Resource Records (RRs), A
   RRs, or AAAA RRs are deemed to be resolvable and to exist in the DNS.
   This is a common practice among Mail Receivers to determine whether
   or not to accept a mail message before performing other more
   expensive processing.









Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 60]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   The DMARC mechanism makes no such requirement for the existence of
   specific DNS RRs in order for a domain to exist; instead, if any RR
   exists for a domain, then the domain exists.  To use the terminology
   from [RFC2308], an "NXDOMAIN" response (rcode "Name Error") to a DNS
   query means that the domain name does not exist, while a "NODATA"
   response (rcode "NOERROR") means that the given resource record type
   queried for does not exist, but the domain name does.

   Furthermore, in keeping with [RFC8020], if a query for a name returns
   NXDOMAIN, then not only does the name not exist, every name below it
   in the DNS hierarchy also does not exist.

A.5.  Organizational Domain Discovery Issues

   An earlier informational version of the DMARC mechanism [RFC7489]
   noted that the DNS does not provide a method by which the "domain of
   record", or the domain that was actually registered with a domain
   registrar, can be determined given an arbitrary domain name.  That
   version further mentioned suggestions that have been made that
   attempt to glean such information from SOA or NS resource records,
   but these too are not fully reliable, as the partitioning of the DNS
   is not always done at administrative boundaries.

   That previous version posited that one could "climb the tree" to find
   the Organizational Domain, but expressed concern that an attacker
   could exploit this for a denial-of-service attack through sending a
   high number of messages each with a relatively large number of
   nonsense labels, causing a Mail Receiver to perform a large number of
   DNS queries in search of a DMARC Policy Record.  This version defines
   a method for performing a DNS Tree Walk (#dns-tree-walk), and further
   mitigates the risk of the denial-of-service attack by expressly
   limiting the number of DNS queries to execute regardless of the
   number of labels in the domain name.

   Readers curious about the previous method for Organizational Domain
   Discovery are directed to Section 3.2 of [RFC7489].

A.6.  Removal of the "pct" Tag

   An earlier informational version of the DMARC mechanism [RFC7489]
   included a "pct" tag and specified all integers from 0 to 100
   inclusive as valid values for the tag.  The intent of the tag was to
   provide domain owners with a method to gradually change their
   preferred Domain Owner Assessment Policy (the "p" tag) from "none" to
   "quarantine" or from "quarantine" to "reject" by requesting the
   stricter treatment for just a percentage of messages that produced
   DMARC results of "fail".




Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 61]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   Operational experience showed that the pct tag was usually not
   accurately applied, unless the value specified was either 0 or 100
   (the default), and the inaccuracies with other values varied widely
   from one implementation to another.  The default value was easily
   implemented, as it required no special processing on the part of the
   Mail Receiver, while the value of 0 took on unintended significance
   as a value used by some intermediaries and mailbox providers as an
   indicator to deviate from standard handling of the message, usually
   by rewriting the RFC5322.From header field in an effort to avoid
   DMARC failures downstream.

   These custom actions when the "pct" tag was set to 0 proved valuable
   to the email community.  In particular, header field rewriting by an
   intermediary meant that a Domain Owner's aggregate reports could
   reveal to the Domain Owner how much of its traffic was routing
   through intermediaries that don't rewrite the RFC5322.From header
   field.  Such information wasn't explicit in the aggregate reports
   received; rather, sussing it out required work on the part of the
   Domain Owner to compare aggregate reports from before and after the
   "p" value was changed and "pct=0" was included in the DMARC Policy
   Record, but the data was there.  Consequently, knowing how much mail
   was subject to possible DMARC failure due to a lack of RFC5322.From
   header field rewriting by intermediaries could assist the Domain
   Owner in choosing whether to move from Monitoring Mode (#monitoring-
   mode) to Enforcement (#enforcement).  Armed with this knowledge, the
   Domain Owner could make an informed decision regarding subjecting its
   mail traffic to possible DMARC failures based on the Domain Owner's
   tolerance for such things.

   Because of the value provided by "pct=0" to Domain Owners, it was
   logical to keep this functionality in the protocol; at the same time,
   it didn't make sense to support a tag named "pct" that had only two
   valid values.  This version of the DMARC mechanism, therefore,
   introduces the "t" tag as shorthand for "testing", with the valid
   values of "y" and "n", which are meant to be analogous in their
   application by mailbox providers and intermediaries to the "pct" tag
   values "0" and "100", respectively.

Appendix B.  Examples

   This section illustrates both the Domain Owner side and the Mail
   Receiver side of a DMARC exchange.

B.1.  Identifier Alignment Examples

   The following examples illustrate the DMARC mechanism's use of
   Identifier Alignment.  For brevity's sake, only message header fields
   and relevant SMTP commands are shown, as message bodies are not
   considered when conducting DMARC checks.

B.1.1.  SPF

   The following SPF examples assume that SPF produces a passing result.
   Alignment cannot exist if SPF does not produce a passing result.

   Example 1: SPF in Strict Alignment:

        MAIL FROM: <sender@example.com>

        From: sender@example.com
        Date: Fri, Feb 15 2002 16:54:30 -0800
        To: receiver@example.org
        Subject: here's a sample

   In this case, the RFC5321.MailFrom domain and the Author Domain are
   identical.  Thus, the identifiers are in Strict Alignment.

   Example 2: SPF in Relaxed Alignment:

        MAIL FROM: <sender@child.example.com>

        From: sender@example.com
        Date: Fri, Feb 15 2002 16:54:30 -0800
        To: receiver@example.org
        Subject: here's a sample

   In this case, the Author Domain (example.com) is a parent of the
   RFC5321.MailFrom domain.  Thus, the identifiers are in relaxed
   alignment because they both have the same Organizational Domain
   (example.com).

   Example 3: No SPF Identifier Alignment:

        MAIL FROM: <sender@example.net>

        From: sender@child.example.com
        Date: Fri, Feb 15 2002 16:54:30 -0800
        To: receiver@example.org
        Subject: here's a sample

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   In this case, the RFC5321.MailFrom domain that is neither the same
   as, a parent of, nor a child of the Author Domain.  Thus, the
   identifiers are not in alignment.

B.1.2.  DKIM

   The examples below assume that the DKIM signatures pass validation.
   Alignment cannot exist with a DKIM signature that does not validate.

   Example 1: DKIM in Strict Alignment:

        DKIM-Signature: v=1; ...; d=example.com; ...
        From: sender@example.com
        Date: Fri, Feb 15 2002 16:54:30 -0800
        To: receiver@example.org
        Subject: here's a sample

   In this case, the DKIM "d" tag and the Author Domain have identical
   DNS domains.  Thus, the identifiers are in Strict Alignment.

   Example 2: DKIM in Relaxed Alignment:

        DKIM-Signature: v=1; ...; d=example.com; ...
        From: sender@child.example.com
        Date: Fri, Feb 15 2002 16:54:30 -0800
        To: receiver@example.org
        Subject: here's a sample

   In this case, the DKIM signature's "d" tag includes a DNS domain that
   is a parent of the Author Domain.  Thus, the identifiers are in
   relaxed alignment, as they have the same Organizational Domain
   (example.com).

   Example 3: No DKIM Identifier Alignment:

        DKIM-Signature: v=1; ...; d=example.net; ...
        From: sender@child.example.com
        Date: Fri, Feb 15 2002 16:54:30 -0800
        To: receiver@example.org
        Subject: here's a sample

   In this case, the DKIM signature's "d" tag includes a DNS domain that
   is neither the same as, a parent of, nor a child of the Author
   Domain.  Thus, the identifiers are not in alignment.

B.2.  Domain Owner Example

   A Domain Owner that wants to use DMARC should have already deployed
   and tested SPF and DKIM.  The next step is to publish a DMARC Policy
   Record for the Domain Owner's Organizational Domain.

B.2.1.  Entire Domain, Monitoring Mode

   The Domain Owner for "example.com" has deployed SPF and DKIM on its
   messaging infrastructure.  The Domain Owner wishes to begin using
   DMARC with a policy that will solicit aggregate feedback from Mail
   Receivers without affecting how the messages are processed in order
   to:

   *  Confirm that its legitimate messages are authenticating correctly

   *  Validate that all authorized message sources have implemented
      authentication measures

   *  Determine how many messages from other sources would be affected
      by publishing a Domain Owner Assessment Policy at Enforcement

   The Domain Owner accomplishes this by constructing a DMARC Policy
   Record indicating that:

   *  The version of DMARC being used is "DMARC1" ("v=DMARC1;")

   *  Mail Receivers should not alter how they treat these messages
      because of this DMARC Policy Record ("p=none")

   *  Aggregate feedback reports are sent via email to the address
      "dmarc-feedback@example.com" ("rua=mailto:dmarc-
      feedback@example.com")

   *  All messages from this Organizational Domain are subject to this
      policy (no "t" tag present, so the default of "n" applies).

   To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for the Domain Owner
   creates an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
   (following the conventional zone file format):

     ; DMARC Policy Record for the domain example.com
     _dmarc  IN TXT ( "v=DMARC1; p=none; "
                      "rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com" )

B.2.2.  Entire Domain, Monitoring Mode, Per-Message Failure Reports

   The Domain Owner from the previous example has used the aggregate
   reporting to discover some messaging systems that had not yet
   implemented DKIM correctly, but they are still seeing periodic
   authentication failures.  To diagnose these intermittent problems,
   they wish to request per-message failure reports when authentication
   failures occur.

   Not all Mail Receivers will honor such a request, but the Domain
   Owner feels that any reports it does receive will be helpful enough
   to justify publishing this record.  The default per-message failure
   report format ([RFC6591]) meets the Domain Owner's needs in this
   scenario.

   The Domain Owner accomplishes this by adding the following to its
   DMARC Policy Record from Appendix B.2.1:

   *  Per-message failure reports are sent via email to the address
      "auth-reports@example.com" ("ruf=mailto:auth-reports@example.com")

   To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for the Domain Owner
   might create an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
   (following the conventional zone file format):

     ; DMARC Policy Record for the domain example.com
     _dmarc  IN TXT ( "v=DMARC1; p=none; "
                      "rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com; "
                      "ruf=mailto:auth-reports@example.com" )

B.2.3.  Per-Message Failure Reports Directed to Third Party

   The Domain Owner from the previous example is maintaining the same
   policy but now wishes to have a third party serve as a Report
   Consumer.  Again, not all Mail Receivers will honor this request, but
   those that do MUST implement additional checks to validate that the
   third party authorizes reception of failure reports on behalf of this
   domain.

   The Domain Owner needs to alter its DMARC Policy Record from
   Appendix B.2.2 as follows:

   *  Per-message failure reports are sent via email to the address
      "auth-reports@thirdparty.example.net" ("ruf=mailto:auth-
      reports@thirdparty.example.net")

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for the Domain Owner
   might create an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
   (following the conventional zone file format):

     ; DMARC Policy Record for the domain example.com
     _dmarc IN TXT ( "v=DMARC1; p=none; "
                     "rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com; "
                     "ruf=mailto:auth-reports@thirdparty.example.net" )

   Because the address used in the "ruf" tag is outside the
   Organizational Domain in which this record is published, conforming
   Mail Receivers MUST implement additional checks as described in
   Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].  To pass these
   additional checks, the Report Consumer's Domain Owner will need to
   publish an additional DMARC Policy Record as follows:

   *  Given the DMARC Policy Record published by the Domain Owner at
      "_dmarc.example.com", the DNS administrator for the Report
      Consumer will need to publish a TXT resource record at
      "example.com._report._dmarc.thirdparty.example.net" with the value
      "v=DMARC1;" to authorize receipt of the reports.

   To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for example.net might
   create an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
   (following the conventional zone file format):

     ; zone file for thirdparty.example.net
     ; Accept DMARC reports on behalf of example.com
     example.com._report._dmarc   IN   TXT    "v=DMARC1;"

B.2.4.  Overriding destination addresses

   The third party Report Consumer can also publish "rua" and "ruf" tags
   in order to override the specific address published by example.com
   with a different address in the same third party domain.  This may be
   necessary if the third party Report Consumer has changed its email
   address, or want to guard against typos in the DMARC Policy Record of
   the Author Domain.  Intermediaries and other third parties should
   refer to Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] for the
   full details of this mechanism.

   The third party Report Consumer accomplishes this by adding the
   following to its DMARC Policy Record from Appendix B.2.3:

   *  The override address for aggregate reports is "aggregate-
      reports@thirdparty.example.net" ("rua=mailto:aggregate-
      reports@thirdparty.example.net")




Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 67]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   *  The override address for failure reports is "failure-
      reports@thirdparty.example.net" ("ruf=mailto:failure-
      reports@thirdparty.example.net")

   To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for example.net might
   create an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
   (following the conventional zone file format):

     ; zone file for thirdparty.example.net
     ; Accept DMARC reports on behalf of example.com
     ; Override destination mailboxes
     example.com._report._dmarc   IN   TXT    (
             "v=DMARC1; "
             "rua=mailto:aggregate-reports@thirdparty.example.net; "
             "ruf=mailto:failure-reports@thirdparty.example.net" )

   In this case only the "ruf" tag is actually overridden, because, in
   the previous example, failure reporting is the only reporting type
   that was directed to the third party Report Consumer.

B.2.5.  Subdomain, Testing, and Multiple Aggregate Report URIs

   The Domain Owner has implemented SPF and DKIM in a subdomain used for
   pre-production testing of messaging services.  It now wishes to
   express a handling preference for messages from this subdomain that
   fail DMARC validation to indicate to participating Mail Receivers
   that use of this domain is not valid.

   As a first step, it will express that it considers messages using
   this subdomain that fail DMARC validation to be suspicious.  The goal
   here will be to enable examination of messages sent to mailboxes
   hosted by participating Mail Receivers as a method for
   troubleshooting any existing authentication issues.  Aggregate
   feedback reports will be sent to a mailbox within the Organizational
   Domain, and to a mailbox at a Report Consumer selected and authorized
   to receive them by the Domain Owner.

   The Domain Owner will accomplish this by constructing a DMARC Policy
   Record indicating that:

   *  The version of DMARC being used is "DMARC1" ("v=DMARC1;")

   *  It is applied only to this subdomain (the DMARC Policy Record is
      published at "_dmarc.test.example.com" and not
      "_dmarc.example.com")

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   *  Mail Receivers are advised that the Domain Owner considers
      messages that fail to authenticate to be suspicious
      ("p=quarantine")

   *  Aggregate feedback reports are sent via email to the addresses
      "dmarc-feedback@example.com" and "example-tld-
      test@thirdparty.example.net" ("rua=mailto:dmarc-
      feedback@example.com, mailto:example-tld-
      test@thirdparty.example.net")

   *  The Domain Owner desires only that an actor performing a DMARC
      validation check apply any special handling rules it might have in
      place, such as rewriting the RFC53322.From header field; the
      Domain Owner is testing its setup at this point and so does not
      want the handling policy to be applied. ("t=y")

   To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for the Domain Owner
   might create an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
   (following the conventional zone file format):

     ; DMARC Policy Record for the domain test.example.com
     _dmarc IN  TXT  ( "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; "
                       "rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com,"
                       "mailto:tld-test@thirdparty.example.net; "
                       "t=y" )

   Once enough time has passed to allow for collecting enough reports to
   give the Domain Owner confidence that all authorized email sent using
   the subdomain is properly authenticating and passing DMARC validation
   checks, then the Domain Owner can update the DMARC Policy Record to
   indicate that it considers validation failures to be a clear
   indication that use of the subdomain is not valid.  It would do this
   by altering the record to advise Mail Receivers of its position on
   such messages ("p=reject") and removing the testing flag ("t=y").

   To publish such a record, the DNS administrator for the Domain Owner
   might create an entry like the following in the appropriate zone file
   (following the conventional zone file format):

     ; DMARC Policy Record for the domain test.example.com
     _dmarc IN  TXT  ( "v=DMARC1; p=reject; "
                       "rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com,"
                       "mailto:tld-test@thirdparty.example.net" )

B.3.  Mail Receiver Example

   A Mail Receiver that wants to participate in DMARC should already be
   checking SPF and DKIM, and possess the ability to collect relevant
   information from various email-processing stages to provide feedback
   to Domain Owners (possibly via Report Consumers).

B.3.1.  SMTP Session Example

   An optimal DMARC-enabled Mail Receiver performs validation and
   Identifier Alignment checking during the SMTP [RFC5321] conversation.

   Before returning a final reply to the DATA command, the Mail
   Receiver's MTA has performed:

   1.  An SPF check to determine an SPF-Authenticated Identifier.

   2.  DKIM checks that yield one or more DKIM-Authenticated
       Identifiers.

   3.  A DMARC Policy Record lookup.

   The presence of an Author Domain DMARC Policy Record indicates that
   the Mail Receiver should continue with DMARC-specific processing
   before returning a reply to the DATA command.

   Given a DMARC Policy Record and the set of Authenticated Identifiers,
   the Mail Receiver checks to see if the Authenticated Identifiers
   align with the Author Domain (taking into consideration any strict
   versus relaxed options found in the DMARC Policy Record).

   For example, the following sample data is considered to be from a
   piece of email originating from the Domain Owner of "example.com":

     Author Domain: example.com
     SPF-authenticated Identifier: mail.example.com
     DKIM-authenticated Identifier: example.com
     DMARC Policy Record:
       "v=DMARC1; p=reject; aspf=r;
        rua=mailto:dmarc-feedback@example.com"

   In the above sample, the SPF-Authenticated Identifier and the DKIM-
   Authenticated Identifier both align with the Author Domain.  The Mail
   Receiver considers the above email to pass the DMARC check, avoiding
   the "reject" policy that is requested to be applied to email that
   fails the DMARC validation check.





Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 70]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   If no Authenticated Identifiers align with the Author Domain, then
   the Mail Receiver applies the Domain Owner Assessment Policy.
   However, before this action is taken, the Mail Receiver can consult
   external information to override the Domain Owner Assessment Policy.
   For example, if the Mail Receiver knows that this particular email
   came from a known and trusted forwarder (that happens to break both
   SPF and DKIM), then the Mail Receiver may choose to ignore the Domain
   Owner Assessment Policy.

   The Mail Receiver is now ready to reply to the DATA command.  If the
   DMARC check yields that the message is to be rejected, then the Mail
   Receiver replies with a 5xy code to inform the sender of failure.  If
   the DMARC check cannot be resolved due to transient network errors,
   then the Mail Receiver replies with a 4xy code to inform the sender
   as to the need to reattempt delivery later.  If the DMARC check
   yields a passing message, then the Mail Receiver continues with email
   processing, perhaps using the result of the DMARC check as an input
   to additional processing modules such as a domain reputation query.

   Before exiting DMARC-specific processing, the Mail Receiver checks to
   see if the Author Domain DMARC Policy Record requests AFRF-based
   reporting.  If so, then the Mail Receiver can emit an AFRF to the
   reporting address supplied in the DMARC Policy Record.

   At the exit of DMARC-specific processing, the Mail Receiver captures
   (through logging or direct insertion into a data store) the result of
   DMARC processing.  Captured information is used to build feedback for
   Domain Owner consumption.  This is unnecessary if the Domain Owner
   has not requested aggregate reports, i.e., no "rua" tag was found in
   the policy record.

B.4.  Organizational and Policy Domain Tree Walk Examples

   If an Author Domain has no DMARC Policy Record, a Mail Receiver uses
   a tree walk to find the DMARC Policy.

   If the DMARC Policy Record allows relaxed alignment and the SPF- or
   DKIM-Authenticated Identifiers are different from the Author Domain,
   a Mail Receiver uses a tree walk to discover the respective
   Organizational Domains to determine Identifier Alignment.

B.4.1.  Simple Organizational and Policy Example

   A Mail Receiver receives an email with:

   *  Author Domain: example.com
   *  RFC5321.MailFrom Domain: example.com
   *  DKIM-Authenticated Identifier: signing.example.com



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 71]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   In this example, "_dmarc.example.com" and
   "_dmarc.signing.example.com" both have DMARC Policy Records while
   "_dmarc.com" does not.  If SPF or DKIM yield pass results, they still
   have to be aligned to support a DMARC pass.  Since not all domains
   are the same, if the alignment is relaxed then the tree walk is
   performed to determine the Organizational Domain for each.

   To determine the Organizational Domain for the Author Domain, query
   "_dmarc.example.com" and "_dmarc.com"; "example.com" is the last
   element of the DNS tree with a DMARC Policy Record, so it is the
   Organizational Domain for "example.com".

   For the RFC5321.MailFrom domain, the Organizational Domain already
   found for "example.com" is "example.com", so SPF is aligned.

   To determine the Organizational Domain for the DKIM-Authenticated
   Identifier, query "_dmarc.signing.example.com", "_dmarc.example.com",
   and "_dmarc.com".  Both "signing.example.com" and "example.com" have
   DMARC Policy Records, but "example.com" is the highest element in the
   tree with a DMARC Policy Record (it has the fewest labels), so
   "example.com" is the Organizational Domain.  Since this is also the
   Organizational Domain for the Author Domain, DKIM is aligned for
   relaxed alignment.

   Since both SPF and DKIM are aligned, they can be used to determine if
   the message has a DMARC pass result.  If the result is not pass, then
   the policy domain's DMARC Policy Record is used to determine the
   appropriate policy.  In this case, since the RFC5322.From domain has
   a DMARC Policy Record, that is the policy domain.

B.4.2.  Deep Tree Walk Example

   A Mail Receiver receives an email with:

   *  Author Domain: a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.example.com
   *  RFC5321.MailFrom Domain: example.com
   *  DKIM-Authenticated Identifier: signing.example.com

   Both "_dmarc.example.com" and "_dmarc.signing.example.com" have DMARC
   Policy Records, while "_dmarc.com" does not.  If SPF or DKIM yield
   pass results, they still have to be aligned to support a DMARC pass.
   Since not all domains are the same, if the alignment is relaxed then
   the tree walk is performed to determine the Organizational Domain for
   each.

   To determine the Organizational Domain For the Author Domain, query
   "_dmarc.a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.example.com", then query
   "_dmarc.g.h.i.j.k.example.com" (skipping the intermediate names),



Herr (ed) & Levine (ed)   Expires 11 July 2025                 [Page 72]

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   then query "_dmarc.h.i.j.k.example.com", "_dmarc.i.j.k.example.com",
   "_dmarc.j.k.example.com", "_dmarc.k.example.com",
   "_dmarc.example.com", and "_dmarc.com".  None of
   "a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.example.com", "g.h.i.j.k.example.com",
   "h.i.j.k.example.com", "i.j.k.example.com", "j.k.example.com", or
   "k.example.com" have a DMARC Policy Record.

   Since "example.com" is the last element of the DNS tree with a DMARC
   Policy Record, it is the Organizational Domain for
   "a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.example.com".

   For the RFC5321.MailFrom domain, the Organizational domain already
   found for "example.com" is "example.com".  SPF is aligned.

   For the DKIM-Authenticated Identifier, query
   "_dmarc.signing.example.com", "_dmarc.example.com", and "_dmarc.com".
   Both "signing.example.com" and "example.com" have DMARC Policy
   Records, but "example.com" is the highest element in the tree with a
   DMARC Policy Record, so "example.com" is the Organizational Domain.
   Since this is also the Organizational Domain for the Author Domain,
   DKIM is aligned for relaxed alignment.

   Since both SPF and DKIM are aligned, they can be used to determine if
   the message has a DMARC pass result.  If the results for both are not
   pass, then the policy domain's DMARC Policy Record is used to
   determine the appropriate policy.  In this case, the Author Domain
   does not have a DMARC Policy Record, so the policy domain is the
   highest element in the DNS tree with a DMARC Policy Record,
   example.com.

B.4.3.  Example with a PSD DMARC Policy Record

   In rare cases, a PSD publishes a DMARC Policy Record with a psd tag,
   which the tree walk must take into account.

   A Mail Receiver receives an email with:

   *  Author Domain: giant.bank.example
   *  RFC5321.MailFrom Domain: mail.giant.bank.example
   *  DKIM-Authenticated Identifier: mail.mega.bank.example

   In this case, "_dmarc.bank.example" has a DMARC Policy Record which
   includes the "psd=y" tag, and "_dmarc.example" does not have a DMARC
   Policy Record.  While "_dmarc.giant.bank.example" has a DMARC Policy
   Record without a "psd" tag, "_dmarc.mega.bank.example" and
   "_dmarc.mail.mega.bank.example" have no DMARC Policy Records.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   Since the three domains are all different, tree walks find their
   Organizational Domains to see which are aligned.

   For the Author Domain "giant.bank.example", the tree walk finds the
   DMARC Policy Record at "_dmarc.giant.bank.example", then the DMARC
   Policy Record at "_dmarc.bank.example", and stops because of the
   "psd=y" flag.  The Organizational Domain is "giant.bank.example"
   because it is the domain directly below the one with "psd=y".  Since
   the Organizational Domain has a DMARC Policy Record, it is also the
   policy domain.

   For the RFC5321.MailFrom domain "mail.giant.bank.example", the tree
   walk finds no DMARC Policy Record at
   "_dmarc.mail.giant.bank.example", but does find both the DMARC Policy
   Record at "_dmarc.giant.bank.example" and then the DMARC Policy
   Record at "_dmarc.bank.example", and stops because of the "psd=y"
   flag.  Again the Organizational Domain is "giant.bank.example"
   because it is the domain directly below the one with "psd=y".  Since
   this is the same Organizational Domain as the Author Domain, SPF is
   aligned.

   For the DKIM-Authenticated Identifier "mail.mega.bank.example", the
   tree walk finds no DMARC Policy Records at
   "_dmarc.mail.mega.bank.example" or "_dmarc.mega.bank.example", then
   finds the DMARC Policy Record at "_dmarc.bank.example" and stops
   because of the "psd=y" flag.  The Organizational Domain is
   "mega.bank.example", so DKIM is not aligned.

   Since SPF is aligned, it can be used to determine if the message has
   a DMARC pass result.  If the result is not pass, then the policy
   domain's DMARC Policy Record is used to determine the appropriate
   policy.

B.5.  Utilization of Aggregate Feedback: Example

   Aggregate feedback is consumed by Domain Owners to enable their
   understanding of how a given domain is being processed by the Mail
   Receiver.  Aggregate reporting data on emails that pass all
   underlying authentication checks is used by Domain Owners to validate
   that their authentication practices remain accurate.  For example, if
   a third party is sending on behalf of a Domain Owner, the Domain
   Owner can use aggregate report data to validate ongoing
   authentication practices of the third party.

   Data on email that only partially passes underlying authentication
   checks provides visibility into problems that need to be addressed by
   the Domain Owner.  For example, if either SPF or DKIM fails to
   produce an Authenticated Identifier, the Domain Owner is provided

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


   with enough information to either directly correct the problem or
   understand where authentication-breaking changes are being introduced
   in the email transmission path.  If authentication-breaking changes
   due to email transmission path cannot be directly corrected, then the
   Domain Owner at least maintains an understanding of the effect of
   DMARC-based policies upon the Domain Owner's email.

   Data on email that fails all underlying authentication checks
   provides baseline visibility on how the Domain Owner's domain is
   being received at the Mail Receiver.  Based on this visibility, the
   Domain Owner can begin deployment of authentication technologies
   across uncovered email sources, if the mail that is failing the
   checks was generated by or on behalf of the Domain Owner.  Data
   regarding failing authentication checks can also allow the Domain
   Owner to come to an understanding of how its domain is being misused.

Appendix C.  Changes from RFC 7489

   This document is intended to render [RFC7489] obsolete.  As one might
   guess, that means there are significant differences between RFC 7489
   and this document.  This section will summarize those changes.

C.1.  Informational vs. Standards Track

   RFC 7489 was not the product of any IETF work stream, but was instead
   published into the RFC series by the Independent Submissions Editor
   and is classified as an Informational RFC.

   This document, by contrast, is intended to be Internet Standards
   Track.

C.2.  Changes to Terminology and Definitions

   The following changes were made to the Terminology and Definitions
   section.

C.2.1.  Terms Added

   These terms were added:

   *  Domain Owner Assessment Policy
   *  Enforcement
   *  Monitoring Mode
   *  Non-existent Domains
   *  Public Suffix Domain (PSD)
   *  Public Suffix Operator (PSO)
   *  PSO Controlled Domain Names

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


C.2.2.  Definitions Updated

   These definitions were updated:

   *  Organizational Domain
   *  Report Receiver (renamed to Report Consumer)

C.3.  Policy Discovery and Organizational Domain Determination

   The algorithms for DMARC policy discovery and for determining the
   Organizational Domain have been changed.  Specifically, reliance on a
   Public Suffix List (PSL) has been replaced by a technique called a
   "DNS Tree Walk", and the methodology for the DNS Tree Walk is
   explained in detail in this document.

   The DNS Tree Walk also incorporates PSD policy discovery, which was
   introduced in [RFC9091].  That RFC was an Experimental RFC, and the
   results of that experiment were that the RFC was not implemented as
   written.  Instead, this document redefines the algorithm for PSD
   policy discovery, and thus obsoletes [RFC9091].  Specifically, the
   DNS Tree Walk defined in this document obviates the need for a PSD
   DMARC registry, and that PSD DMARC registry is what made RFC 9091 an
   Experimental RFC.

   These algorithm changes introduce the possibility of interoperability
   issues where a Domain Owner expects a DMARC Policy Record or an
   Organizational Domain to be identified by the Tree Walk process, but
   a Mail Receiver using an RFC 7489-based implementation of DMARC and
   relying on a PSL might arrive at a different answer.

   This issue is entirely avoided by the use of Strict Alignment and
   publishing explicit DMARC Policy Records for all Author Domains used
   in an organization's email.

C.4.  Reporting

   Discussion of both aggregate and failure reporting have been moved to
   separate documents dedicated to the topics.

   In addition, the ability to specify a maximum report size in the
   DMARC URI has been removed.

C.5.  Tags

   Several tags have been added to the "DMARC Policy Record Format"
   section of this document since RFC 7489 was published, and at the
   same time, several others were removed.

Internet-Draft                  DMARCbis                    January 2025


C.5.1.  Tags Added

   *  np - Policy for non-existent domains (Imported from [RFC9091])
   *  psd - Flag indicating whether a domain is a Public Suffix Domain
   *  t - Replacement for some pct tag functionality.  See Appendix A.6
      for further discussion

C.5.2.  Tags Removed

   *  pct - Tag requesting application of DMARC policy to only a
      percentage of messages.  See Appendix A.6 for discussion
   *  rf - Tag specifying requested format of failure reports
   *  ri - Tag specifying requested interval between aggregate reports

C.6.  Expansion of Domain Owner Actions Section

   RFC 7489 had just two paragraphs in its Domain Owner Actions section,
   and while the content of those paragraphs was correct, it was
   minimalist in its approach to providing guidance to domain owners on
   just how to implement DMARC.

   This document provides much more detail and explanatory text to a
   Domain Owner, focusing not just on what to do to implement DMARC, but
   also on the reasons for each step and the repercussions of each
   decision.

   In particular, this document makes explicit that domains for general-
   purpose email SHOULD NOT deploy a DMARC policy of p=reject.  See
   Section 7.4 for further discussion of this topic.

C.7.  Report Generator Recommendations

   In the cases where a DMARC Policy Record specifies multiple
   destinations for either aggregate reports or failure reports, RFC
   7489 stated:

  Receivers **MAY** impose a limit on the number of URIs to which they
  will send reports but **MUST** support the ability to send to at least
  two.

   This document in Section 4.6 says:

    A report **SHOULD** be sent to each listed URI provided in the DMARC
    Policy Record.

C.8.  Removal of RFC 7489 Appendix A.5

   One of the appendices in RFC 7489, specifically Appendix A.5, has
   been removed from the text with this update.  The appendix was titled
   "Issues with ADSP in Operation" and it contained a list of issues
   associated with ADSP that influenced the direction of DMARC.  The
   ADSP protocol was moved to "Historic" status in 2013 and working
   group consensus was that such a discussion of ADSP's influence on
   DMARC was no longer relevant.

C.9.  RFC 7489 Errata Summary

   This document and its companion documents
   ([I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] and
   [I-D.ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting]) address the following errata
   filed against [RFC7489] since that document's publication in March,
   2015.  More details on each of these can be found at https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=7489 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/
   errata_search.php?rfc=7489)

C.9.1.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 5365, RFC 7489, Section 7.2.1.1
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5365)

   Addressed in [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

C.9.2.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 5371, RFC 7489, Section 7.2.1.1
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5371)

   Addressed in [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

C.9.3.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 5440, RFC 7489, Sections 7.1, B.2.1,
        B.2.3, and B.2.4 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5440)

   This erratum references several mentions in RFC 7489 of the "v=" tag
   from the Domain Owner Assessment Policy and/or its value,
   specifically mentions that were not, but should have been,
   "v=DMARC1;".  Some of those mentions are preserved in this document
   and those mentions have been addressed as per the erratum.  The rest
   have moved to [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting] and are addressed
   there.

C.9.4.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 6439, RFC 7489, Section 7.1
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6439)

   Addressed in [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

C.9.5.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 5221, RFC 7489, Appendix C
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5221)

   The regular expression pattern for IP addresses has been removed from
   this document and from [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

C.9.6.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 5229, RFC 7489, Appendix C
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5229)

   Addressed in [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

C.9.7.  RFC Errata, Erratum 5495, RFC 7489, Section 6.6.3
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5495)

   This erratum is in reference to the description of the process
   documented in RFC 7489 for the applicable DMARC policy for an email
   message.  The process for doing this has drastically changed in
   DMARCbis, and so the text identified in this erratum no longer
   exists.

C.9.8.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 6485, RFC 7489, Section 7.2.1.1
        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6485)

   Addressed in [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

        (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6729)

   This erratum is in reference to a search of the Public Suffix List
   (PSL) as part of finding a DMARC Policy Record (a.k.a., Domain Owner
   Assessment Policy).  The PSL is no longer relied upon for this
   practice, and the text at issue has been removed from this document.

C.9.10.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 7099, RFC 7489, Section 7.2.1.1
         (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7099)

         (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7835)

   This erratum is in reference to the description of the process
   documented in RFC 7489 for the applicable DMARC policy for an email
   message.  The process for doing this has drastically changed in
   DMARCbis, and so the text identified in this erratum no longer
   exists.

         (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7865)

   The regular expression pattern for IP addresses has been removed from
   this document and from [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

C.9.14.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 5151, RFC 7489, Section 1
         (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5151)

   This erratum is in reference to the Introduction section of RFC 7489.
   That section has been substantially rewritten in DMARCbis, and the
   text at issue for this erratum no longer exists.

C.9.15.  RFC Errata, Erratum ID 5774, RFC 7489, Appendix C
         (https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5774)

   Addressed in [I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

C.10.  General Editing and Formatting

   A great deal of the content from RFC 7489 was preserved in this
   document, but much of it was subject to either minor editing, re-
   ordering of sections, and/or both.
